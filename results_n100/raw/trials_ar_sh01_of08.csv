19,1,ar,"First, let's determine the total distance Marissa has walked so far:
- She walked 4 miles in the first hour.
- She walked 2 miles in the next hour.

Thus, she has walked a total of:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's determine how many hours she has spent walking so far:
- She spent 1 hour for the first 4 miles.
- She spent 1 hour for the next 2 miles.

Thus, she has spent a total of:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how long she has left, we subtract the time spent:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour and she has only 2 hours left:
\[ 4 \text{ miles per hour} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the required speed is:
\[ \boxed{6 \text{ miles per hour}} \]",6,0,

29,9,ar,"To determine the cost of the boots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels.
2. Use the information that the total cost of the high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots to find the cost of the boots.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:
- One pair of heels costs $33.
- The other pair of heels costs twice as much, so it costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \(33 + 66 = 99\) dollars.

Next, we know that the total cost of the high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Let \(B\) represent the cost of the boots.
- So, \(99 = B - 5\).
- Solving for \(B\), we add 5 to both sides of the equation: \(99 + 5 = B\).
- Therefore, \(B = 104\).

\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the remaining 180 days. Since the puppy is fed 2 cups per day, we have:

\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 360 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total amount of dog food consumed in a year:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups} \]

53,25,ar,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each: \(6 \times 60 = 360\)
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each: \(4 \times 40 = 160\)
- Therefore, the total revenue for Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\)

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each: \(12 \times 40 = 480\)
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires on Friday, so the revenue from truck tires is \(0\)
- Therefore, the total revenue for Friday is \(480 + 0 = 480\)

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
\[520 - 480 = 40\]

The final result is 40.",40,0,

24,33,ar,"To determine the original price of the book, we need to work backward from the price Kyle paid, which was $19.50. The price he paid represents the remaining 75% of the original price after a 25% discount.

Let's denote the original price of the book by \( P \).

Step 1: Understand the relationship between the discounted price and the original price.
- The discounted price is 75% of the original price.
- Therefore, \( 0.75P = 19.50 \).

Step 2: Solve for the original price \( P \).
- To isolate \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75.
- \( P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \).

Step 3: Perform the division.
- \( P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = \frac{19.50}{\frac{3}{4}} = 19.50 \times 4 = 78 \).

The original price of the book was $78.",26,0,

2. He sells each lego set for $15, so he makes \(13 \times 15 = 195\) dollars.
3. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, so he spends \(8 \times 20 = 160\) dollars.
4. He has $5 left after buying the video games.
5. The total amount John spent on video games is \(160 + 5 = 165\) dollars.
6. Therefore, John needs to make \(195 - 165 = 30\) more dollars to cover the cost of the video games and have $5 left.
7. He needs to sell enough lego sets to make an additional $30. Each lego set sells for $15, so he needs \(\frac{30}{15} = 2\) more lego sets.
8. John has already sold all 13 lego sets and needs to sell 2 more, so he still has \(13 - 2 = 11\) lego sets.

1. Calculate the cost of the donuts:
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.

   - Total cost for donuts = \(3 \times 68 = 204\)

2. Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cupcakes = $80
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \(2 \times 80 = 160\)

3. Calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cheesecakes = $55

\[ 38 = G - 2 \]
Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

Thus, Gerald originally ran the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds.

Gerald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from the original time:
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - 0.10 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - 4 \]
\[ \text{New time} = 36 \]

Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.",36,0,

97,49,ar,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to account for the loss of volume from cooking and the number of tomatoes she gets from each can.

1. **Determine the original volume of the tomatoes used:**
   - Freda's tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When cooked, the tomatoes lose half their volume.
   - Therefore, the original volume of the tomatoes used was 32 ounces.

2. **Calculate the number of cans needed:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - To find the number of cans, we divide the total volume of the tomatoes used by the volume of each can:
     \[
     \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 2 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
     \[
     2 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 6 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

1. **Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used:**
   Candice had 23 Post-it notes remaining after placing one on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, the number of Post-it notes she used is:
   \[
   220 - 23 = 197
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially:**
   Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse initially.

3. **Calculate the number of Post-it notes in the package:**
   The total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially is the sum of the Post-it notes in her purse and the Post-it notes in the package. If she used 197 Post-it notes and had 80 in her purse, then the number of Post-it notes in the package is:
   \[
   197 - 80 = 117

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package is 117",163,0,

2. The first half of the year has 6 months.
3. Therefore, she pays \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars for the first half of the year.
4. For the second half of the year, she pays 10% less than the initial monthly charge.
5. First, calculate 10% of $140, which is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
6. Thus, she pays \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars per month for the second half of the year.
7. The second half of the year has 6 months.
8. Therefore, she pays \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars for the second half of the year.
9. Adding the amounts from both halves of the year gives the total amount paid:

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.
- Total potato salad needed for adults = 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.
- Total potato salad needed for children = 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds.

Finally, we sum the amounts needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad needed:
- Total amount of potato salad needed = 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.",225,0,

1. **First month:**
   \[
   \text{Downloads} = 60

2. **Second month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times as many as the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads} = 180 - 0.30 \times 180 = 180 - 54 = 126

2. For the first half of the year (6 months), she paid the full $140 per month.
3. For the second half of the year (6 months), she was charged 10% less per month. 

First, let's calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year:
\[ \text{Amount for the first half} = 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, let's calculate the amount she paid for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Amount for the second half} = 140 \times (1 - 0.10) \times 6 = (140 \times 0.90) \times 6 = 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Finally, add the amounts from both halves to get the total amount paid by the end of the year:
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

1. **Number of players per team:**
   - Each team has 5 players.

2. **Number of teams per school:**
   - Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').

3. **Number of players per school:**
   - Each team has 5 players, so for 2 teams: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) players.

4. **Number of coaches per school:**
   - Each school has 1 coach for each team, so for 2 teams: \(1 \times 2 = 2\) coaches.

5. **Total number of people per school:**
   - Add the number of players and coaches per school: \(10 + 2 = 12\) people per school.

6. **Total number of people per all schools:**
   - There are 4 schools, so the total is \(12 \times 4 = 48\) people.

\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, calculate the remaining days in a year.
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

Now, calculate the amount of dog food the puppy consumes in the remaining days.
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, add the total amount of dog food consumed in both periods.
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, determine how many bags of dog food the total amount will require.
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \boxed{5 \text{ bags}} \]",5,0,

1. **First month:**
   - The number of downloads is given as 60.

2. **Second month:**
   - The number of downloads is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \(3 \times 60 = 180\).

3. **Third month:**
   - The number of downloads is reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   - The number of downloads in the third month is \(180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126\).

4. **Total downloads over the three months:**
   - Add the number of downloads from each month:
   - Total = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366\).

Thus, the total number of downloads the program had over the three months is \(366\).",366,0,

1. **Total Revenue Calculation:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - He makes and sells 20 candles.
   - Total revenue = Number of candles \(\times\) Selling price per candle
   - Total revenue = 20 \(\times\) 2.00 = $40.00

2. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Charlie needs one pound of beeswax and wicks to make 10 candles.
   - Since he makes 20 candles, he needs \(\frac{20}{10} = 2\) pounds of beeswax.
   - Total cost = Number of pounds \(\times\) Cost per pound
   - Total cost = 2 \(\times\) 10.00 = $20.00

3. **Net Profit Calculation:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find the total number of eggs produced in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we determine how many dozens of eggs are produced in a week. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2:

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \(\frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2\) more articles than on Monday. Therefore, she wrote \(5 + 2 = 7\) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles as she did on Tuesday. Therefore, she wrote \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles.

**Step 2: Sum the total number of articles written over the three days.**

Total articles = 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

26,137,ar,"To determine how much Mishka spent in total on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost for each type of clothing and then sum these costs.

1. Calculate the cost of the shorts:
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, and one pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

2. Calculate the cost of the pants:
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants, and one pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

3. Calculate the cost of the shoes:
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes, and one pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 * $42 = $126.

4. Sum the costs for all the clothing items:
   - Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

92,145,ar,"To determine Jackson's age, we need to follow a series of logical steps based on the given information. Let's start by defining the ages of the kids:

1. Let \( J \) be James's age.
2. Let \( A \) be Amy's age.
3. Let \( C \) be Corey's age.
4. Let \( M \) be Jackson's age.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:

- \( J = 10 \)
- \( J = C - 1 \)
- \( A = M + 5 \)
- \( A = C - 2 \)

Using the information \( J = C - 1 \), we can substitute \( J \) with 10:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age, we can use the information \( A = C - 2 \) to find Amy's age:
\[ A = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Next, using the information \( A = M + 5 \), we can find Jackson's age:
\[ \boxed{4 \]",4,0,

94,145,ar,"Let's denote the number of dogs as \( d \). According to the problem, the number of dogs is 60, so we have:
\[ d = 60 \]

The problem also states that there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
\[ 2d = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of rabbits. The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
\[ d + 2d = 60 + 120 = 180 \]
So, the number of rabbits is:
\[ 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ d + 2d + 168 = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:

3. The sum of their ages is given as 162:
   \[

4. Combine the terms on the left side:

1. Calculate the delivery fee.
2. Add the delivery fee to the original total bill.
3. Add the tip to the sum of the delivery fee and the original bill.

First, calculate the delivery fee. The delivery fee is 25% of the original bill plus $3.00.

Next, add the delivery fee to the original total bill. The original bill is $40.00.

Finally, add the tip to the sum of the delivery fee and the original bill. The tip is $4.00.

1. **Calculate the number of players per school:**
   - Each school has a girls' team and a boys' team.
   - Each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school has \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) players.

2. **Calculate the number of coaches per school:**
   - Each team has one coach.
   - There are 2 teams (girls' and boys').
   - Therefore, each school has \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) coaches.

3. **Calculate the total number of people per school:**
   - Each school has 10 players and 2 coaches.
   - Therefore, each school has \( 10 + 2 = 12 \) people.

4. **Calculate the total number of people for all four schools:**
   - There are 4 schools.
   - Each school has 12 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) people.",48,0,

3. Determine the number of rabbits based on the given information.
4. Calculate the total number of pets by summing the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Given:
- The number of dogs is 60.
- There are two cats for every dog.

First, calculate the number of cats:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Finally, calculate the total number of pets:
\[ \text{Total pets} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

Step 1: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners.

Step 2: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Step 3: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners. This means she has \( \frac{x}{3} + 1 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so \( \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, Melanie started with \(12\) vacuum cleaners.",18,0,

52,177,ar,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove to meet the goal of removing 15 pounds from his book bag, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removes.

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books:
\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much additional weight he needs to remove to reach 15 pounds. He has already removed 7.5 pounds from the comic books:
\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to remove 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:
\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final result is:

1. **Cindy's Pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's Pets:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Jan's Pets:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

Now, we sum the number of pets each person has:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
\]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week.
2. Determine the total number of hours John runs in a day.
3. Calculate the total distance John runs in a day.
4. Determine John's running speed.

First, let's find out how many hours John runs in a day:
- On the first day, John runs 3 hours.
- On the second day, John runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- On the third day, John runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- Therefore, the total number of hours John runs in a day is \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6.5 \) hours.

Next, we need to determine how far John runs in a day. Since John runs 60 miles a week and he runs 3 days a week, we can calculate the distance he runs in a day by dividing the total weekly distance by",10,0,

31,193,ar,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the average of the estimates given by Gunter's friends. Let's break down each estimate step by step.

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate. Half of 80 is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\), so the second friend says \(40 + 20 = 60\) jelly beans.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's estimate. 25% of 80 is \(\frac{25}{100} \times 80 = 20\), so the third friend says \(80 + 20 = 100\) jelly beans.

Now, we need to find the sum of these estimates:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

Next, we calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of friends, which is 3:
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80

- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

Adding these together, we get the total number of dance classes in a week:

1. Determine the number of lollipops Jean has after eating some.
2. Calculate how many bags can be filled with these lollipops, given that each bag contains 2 lollipops.

Step 1: Determine the number of lollipops Jean has after eating some.
Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2 of them. So, we subtract 2 from 30:
\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \]
Therefore, Jean has 28 lollipops left.

Step 2: Calculate how many bags can be filled with the remaining lollipops, given that each bag contains 2 lollipops.
To find out how many bags can be filled with 28 lollipops, we divide the number of lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \]
Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

12,209,ar,"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to compare the annual revenue from selling lemons to the annual costs.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- The tree grows 7 lemons each year.
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual costs:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, let's find the annual profit:
- Profit = Revenue - Cost
- Profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the annual profit to cover the initial cost.

Let's calculate the number of years required:
- Number of years = Initial cost / Annual profit
- Number of years = $90 / $7.5 = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.",13,0,

18,217,ar,"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can break the problem down into several steps.

First, calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in one week. She makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week.
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks. If she eats 21 eggs per week, then in 4 weeks she will eat:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen. To find out how many dozens 84 eggs are, divide 84 by 12.
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.",7,0,

2. She needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again.
3. The owner's manual says her tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

First, we need to determine how many gallons of gas she has already used to travel the 100 miles. 

Since she used 4 gallons to fill up her tank again, she has already used 4 gallons to travel the 100 miles.

Next, we can calculate the remaining gallons in the tank:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} - 4 \text{ gallons} = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of gas (12 gallons), we divide the total distance traveled (100 miles) by the gallons used (4 gallons):
\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} \]

Thus, we get:
\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = 25 \]

First, calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
10 \text{ pounds/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ pounds}

Next, calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:

- There are 5 children.

\[
5 \text{ pounds/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ pounds}

Finally, add the amounts needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad needed:

   - A 300g bag has 5 servings.
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - Total calories in a 300g bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

2. Calculate how many calories are left to consume.
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Calories left to consume = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.
   - A 300g bag has 1250 calories.
   - Number of bags you can eat = 200 calories / 1250 calories/bag = 0.167 bags.
   - Total grams of chips you can eat = 0.167 bags * 300g/bag = 50g.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings as a teacher:
- Jill gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings as a teacher = $20/hour * 35 hours = $700.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings as a coach:
- Jill gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings as a coach = $30/hour * 15 hours = $450.

Now, let's add her weekly earnings as a teacher and a coach to find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = $700 + $450 = $1150.

Finally, let's calculate her annual salary by multiplying her weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a year:
- Annual salary = $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57500.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57500.",57500,0,

First, let's find the distances:

- The first stop is 20 miles from the start of the trip.
- The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the second stop is:
  \[
  60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops:
- The distance from the start to the first stop is 20 miles.
- The distance from the start to the second stop is 45 miles.
- The difference between these distances is:
  \[
  45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles}

- Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
- He sails for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM).

Using the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time, we get:

\[
\text{Distance} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}

Now, we need to determine how long it takes Tom to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

- Tom travels back at 6 miles per hour.
- The distance back is the same as the distance he traveled going out, which is 30 miles.

Using the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed, we get:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}

2. **Number of cats:**
   There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, and one pair costs $16.50.
\[ 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants, and one pair costs $22.50.
\[ 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \]

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes, and one pair costs $42.00.
\[ 3 \times 42.00 = 126.00 \]

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total cost:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00 = 243.00 \]

2. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
3. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought.
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, let's determine the number of red ties John bought.
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie.
\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 0.5 \times 40 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of all the ties.

2. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
3. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

First, let's calculate the number of blue ties John bought.

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Next, we know he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties.

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the cost of one blue tie is $40. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of one red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of one red tie} = 40 \times 1.5 = 60 \]

Finally, calculate the total amount spent on all types of ties:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Determine the selling price of the house.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the original cost from the selling price.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000, and it increased by 150% due to the repairs. Therefore, the increase in value is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]
So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to determine the selling price of the house. Let's assume he sold it for $200,000.

Now, we calculate the profit by subtracting the original cost from the selling price:

Step 1: Calculate the number of downloads in the second month.
The number of downloads in the first month is 60. The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
\[ \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of downloads in the third month.
The number of downloads in the second month is 180, and it reduced by 30% in the third month. To find the number of downloads in the third month, we calculate 70% of 180.
\[ \text{Downloads in the third month} = 0.70 \times 180 = 126 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of downloads over the three months.

\[ 5 \times 250 = 1250 \text{ calories per bag} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories, so:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories remaining} \]

Now, since each serving is 250 calories, we can determine how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories:

\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Finally, we convert these servings into grams because each serving is 300 grams:

\[ 0.8 \times 300 = 240 \text{ grams} \]

1. If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Given that Marcy quits after 30 years, we need to calculate her annual pension based on the number of years she has worked.

Since Marcy has worked for 30 years, which is more than 20 years, she is eligible for 5% of the pension value per year.

To find the annual pension, we first need to determine the total pension value. However, the problem does not provide the total pension value. Instead, it mentions that after 20 years, she gets 5% of the pension value per year. Therefore, we can infer that her annual pension is 5% of the total pension value.

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and that Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can express Lee's speed in terms of Gerald's time:

\[
\text{Lee's speed} = \frac{1}{38}
\]

Since Lee's speed is inversely proportional to his time, we can express Lee's time in terms of Gerald's speed:

\[
\text{Lee's time} = 38 \text{ seconds}
\]

Gerald's speed is inversely proportional to his time. We know that Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. Therefore, Gerald's new speed is:

\[
\text{Gerald's new speed} = \frac{1}{38} \times 1.10 = \frac{1}{37.8}
\]

So, Gerald's new time for the 400-meter hurdles is:

\[

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
- Total cost for donuts = 3 * 68 = $204

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
- Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 * 80 = $160

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
- Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
204 + 160 + 330 = 694

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units:

\[
\text{Total number of units} = 15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Next, we determine the number of occupied units. Since \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the building is occupied:

\[
\text{Number of occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Now, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:

\[
\text{Number of unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30

1. **Determine Alex's weight:**
   - Grace weighs 125 pounds.
   - Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.
   - Calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
     \[
     4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds}

   - Subtract 2 pounds from 500 pounds to get Alex's weight:
     \[

     \]
   - Therefore, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

2. **Calculate their combined weights:**
   - Grace's weight: 125 pounds.
   - Alex's weight: 498 pounds.
   - Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight:

2. Determine the total number of students at the school.
3. Calculate the number of teachers based on the given ratio of students to teachers.

First, we know there are 60 girls at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we calculate the number of boys as follows:

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:
\[

We are given that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the ratio of students to teachers:

1. Identify the number of diamonds.
2. Calculate the number of rubies.
3. Calculate the number of emeralds.
4. Sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to get the total number of gems.

1. The number of diamonds is given as 175.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. Therefore, the number of rubies is:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]
4. Now, we sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to get the total number of gems:
   \[
   175 + 140 + 280 = 595

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins. According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins can be expressed as \( G = S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is given as 110. This can be represented as:
\[ S + G = 110 \]

Substituting the expression for \( G \) into the equation, we get:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Thus, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(70\).",70,0,

1. If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of her pension per year.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she is eligible for the 5% annual pension rate. Let's assume her pension value is \(V\).

To find the value of \(V\), we use the information that 5% of \(V\) equals her annual pension when she quits:
\[ 0.05V = 50,000 \]

To solve for \(V\), divide both sides by 0.05:
\[ V = \frac{50,000}{0.05} \]
\[ V = 100,000 \]

Thus, if Marcy's pension value is $100,000, her annual pension when she quits will be $50,000.",25000,0,

\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the second half of the year. The streaming company charges 10% less for the second half of the year. To find the reduced price, we calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from the original $140:

\[ 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \]
So, the reduced price per month is:
\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \]

Now, calculate the cost for the second half of the year:

\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Finally, add the costs from both halves:

Each installment is for 3 months, so the total amount of money Shiela needs to pay in installments is:

\[
750 \div 3 = 250

There is a 2% interest charge on each installment. To find the interest for one installment, we calculate:

\]

Therefore, the total amount Shiela will need to pay for one installment, including interest, is:

\[
250 + 5 = 255

First, let's break down the problem:

1. If Marcy works for 40 years, she receives an annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of her total pension per year.

Since Marcy works only 30 years, she does not reach the 20-year mark. Therefore, her pension benefits will not change based on the 20-year rule.

Given that she works for 30 years, she will receive the full 50,000 annual pension for those 30 years.

To find the total pension amount over 30 years, we multiply the annual pension by the number of years:

67,345,ar,"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

4. **Total number of gems:**
   - To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
     \[
     175 + 140 + 280 = 595
     \]

The final numeric result is:

1. Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
2. Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child dinosaur eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) pounds of potato salad.
3. There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic.

First, calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults:
\[
20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, calculate the total amount of potato salad for the children:
\[
5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, add the amounts for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad needed:
\[
200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = \boxed{225 \text{ pounds}}

1. Distance walked in the first hour: 4 miles
2. Distance walked in the second hour: 2 miles

Total distance walked so far:
4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles

Total time spent walking so far:
1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Next, we need to find the speed required to complete the remaining distance at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total distance of the trail: 12 miles
Remaining distance: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

Total time available for the trail:
2 hours (already spent)

We need to find the speed at which she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 2 hours.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 2 hours
Speed = 3 miles per hour

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 3 miles per hour.

\]
\[
\text{Calories per serving} \times \text{Number of servings} = 250 \times 5 = 1250 \text{ calories}

Next, we know the daily calorie target is 2000 calories and we have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories we can consume are:

\[
2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

Since each serving has 250 calories, the number of servings we can eat without exceeding the remaining calories is:

\[
\frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings}

62,369,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension after working 30 years, we need to consider the given conditions:

1. If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Since Marcy works for 30 years, which is less than 40 years but more than 20 years, she falls into the second condition.

To find the value of the pension at 30 years, we need to assume that the pension grows linearly based on the number of years worked. However, the problem does not provide the exact value of the pension at 30 years. Assuming the pension grows linearly and the exact value is not provided, we will use the percentage calculation directly.

Since the pension grows linearly and the exact value is not provided, we assume the pension is calculated as 5% of the value at 30 years.

Thus, the annual pension after working 30 years is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of the pension value at 30 years} \]",25000,0,

1. **Determine Raymond's current age:**
   - We know that Samantha is currently 31 years old.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, Raymond's current age is \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

2. **Determine the age of Raymond's son:**
   - Raymond had a son at 23 years old.
   - Since Raymond is currently 25 years old, his son is currently \(25 - 23 = 2\) years old.

3. **Calculate how many years ago Raymond's son was born:**
   - To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the current age of Raymond's son from the current year.
   - If the current year is \(x\), then the year Raymond's son was born is \(x - 2\) years.

However, the problem does not provide the current year. Therefore, the number of years ago Raymond's son was born is simply:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week.
\[
252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}
\]

**Step 2: Convert the number of eggs into dozens.**

There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
\[
\frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12} = 147 \text{ dozens}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells each dozen for $2.
\[
147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars}

\[
\text{Total cost} = 150 \times 5 = 750

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month period. The interest rate is 2%, so the interest for one month is:

\]

Since the interest is charged for 3 months, the total interest is:

\[
\text{Total interest} = 15 \times 3 = 45
\]

The total amount Shiela needs to pay is the sum of the total cost and the total interest:

\[

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

   - Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.

3. **Calculate Gerald's new running time:**
   - Subtract the improvement from Gerald's original running time to find his new running time.

2. **Determine the number of cans used:**

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced in a week.
2. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced in a week. Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. Therefore, the revenue from selling 147 dozens is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]",294,0,

Now, calculate the time it takes to download the first 80 GB:

2. Subtract this total cost from the total amount paid to find the total cost of the pizza boxes.
3. Divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box to find the number of boxes ordered.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:

- Chicken meal: $12
- 5 packs of milk: \(5 \times 3 = 15\)
- 4 apples: \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\)

Adding these costs together gives:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\]

Next, we subtract this total cost from the total amount paid to find the cost of the pizza boxes:

1. **Calculate the number of basketball players per school:**
   - Each school has both a girls' and a boys' basketball team.
   - Each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school has \(5 + 5 = 10\) basketball players.

2. **Calculate the number of coaches per school:**
   - Each school has one coach for each team.
   - Since each team has 5 players, each school has \(5\) coaches.

3. **Calculate the total number of people per school:**
   - Each school has \(10\) basketball players and \(5\) coaches.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(10 + 5 = 15\) people.

4. **Calculate the total number of people sent by all four schools:**
   - There are 4 schools, and each school sends 15 people.

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, we find the total number of units in the building:

Next, we calculate the number of occupied units. Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied:
\[

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:

\[
\text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:

\[
\text{Number of toys} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15

1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:

1. \( w + l = 22 \)
2. \( w = l + 8 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we substitute the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (l + 8) + l = 22 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2l + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2l = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ l = 7 \]

Now, substitute \( l = 7 \) back into the second equation to find \( w \):

\[ w = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

1. **Calculate the number of boys:**
   - Total number of students = 200
   - Fraction of boys = \( \frac{2}{5} \)
   - Number of boys = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \)

2. **Calculate the number of girls:**
   - Total students = 200
   - Total girls = 200 - 80 = 120

3. **Calculate the number of girls in the girl scout:**
   - Fraction of girls in the girl scout = \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Number of girls in the girl scout = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \)

4. **Calculate the number of girls not in the girl scout:**
   - Total girls = 120
   - Girls in the girl scout = 80
   - Girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

24,449,ar,"To determine the original price of the book, we need to work backwards from the given information. Kyle paid $19.50 for the book after a 25% discount. This means he paid 75% of the original price.

Let \( P \) be the original price of the book. The price Kyle paid can be expressed as:
\[ 0.75P \]

We know this is equal to $19.50:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Performing the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = \frac{19.50}{\frac{3}{4}} = 19.50 \times \frac{4}{3} = 19 \times \frac{4}{3} = 26 \]

Next, calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink.
\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, add the amounts of water from both drinks to find the total amount of water before the spill.
\[ \text{Total water before spill} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Subtract the spilled orange drink from the total water.
\[ \text{Water after spill} = \frac{47}{3} - 1 = \frac{44}{3} \text{ liters} \]

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received is:

\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we add the water the two girls received to the water the boy received. The boy received 6 liters. So, the total amount of water used is:

\[
8 + 6 = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water to find out how many liters of water are left. The initial amount of water is 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[
24 - 14 = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204

So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160

So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330

So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, sum the costs of all the pastries:

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = 5 + \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \).

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \).

4. **Total number of articles:**
   - Total articles = 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

5. **Total hours spent:**

54,473,ar,"To determine the total number of kittens in the Doubtfire family, we need to add the kittens adopted from the shelter to the kittens born from the house cats.

1. **Kittens adopted from the shelter:**
   The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens.

2. **Kittens had by Patchy:**
   Patchy has had three times the number of kittens adopted from the shelter. Since 7 kittens were adopted, Patchy has had:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ kittens}
   \]

3. **Kittens had by Trixie:**
   Trixie has had 12 kittens.

4. **Total number of kittens:**
   To find the total number of kittens, we add the kittens adopted from the shelter, the kittens Patchy has had, and the kittens Trixie has had:
   \[
   7 + 21 + 12 = 40
   \]

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has a total of 40 kittens.

47,481,ar,"First, we need to determine the cost of the red ties. Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, we calculate:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Next, we know that John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. Let \( x \) be the number of blue ties. Then, the number of red ties is \( 2x \).

John spent $200 on blue ties at $40 each, so the number of blue ties is:

\[
x = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Thus, the number of red ties is:

\[
2x = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The total cost for the red ties is:

\[
10 \times 60 = 600

Adding the cost of the blue and red ties gives:

1. Calculate the annual pension for the first 20 years.
2. Determine the annual pension for the last 10 years based on the given percentage.

First, let's calculate the annual pension for the first 20 years:
\[
\text{Annual pension for first 20 years} = \$50,000
\]

Next, we need to determine the annual pension for the last 10 years. The pension for the last 10 years is 5% of the initial annual pension for the first 20 years. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\text{Annual pension for last 10 years} = 0.05 \times \$50,000
\]

Performing the multiplication:
\[
\text{Annual pension for last 10 years} = \$2,500
\]

Thus, Marcy's annual pension for the last 10 years of her work is \$2,500.

First, let's calculate the amount of food consumed in the first 180 days:

Next, let's calculate the amount of food consumed in the remaining 180 days:

Now, add the two amounts together:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 110-cup bags are required to hold 540 cups:

1. Calculate the number of sprints James runs in a week.
2. Determine the distance James runs in one sprint.
3. Multiply the number of sprints by the distance per sprint to find the total distance run in a week.

First, let's calculate the number of sprints James runs in a week:
- He runs 3 sprints per day.
- He runs 3 times a week.
- Therefore, the number of sprints per week is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) sprints.

Next, let's determine the distance James runs in one sprint:
- He runs 60 meters per sprint.

Finally, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance per sprint to find the total distance run in a week:
- Total distance = Number of sprints \(\times\) Distance per sprint
- Total distance = \(9 \times 60\)
- Total distance = 540 meters

Thus, the total number of meters James runs in a week is \(540\).",540,0,

1. **Monday:**
   Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   She wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[
5 + 7 + 14 = 26
\]

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[
26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:

3. From the problem, we have the following information:
   - The total number of coins is 110:
     \[
     S + G = 110
     \]
   - There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
     \[
     G = S + 30

4. Substitute \( G \) from the second equation into the first equation:
   \[
   S + (S + 30) = 110
   \]
   \[
   2S + 30 = 110

   \[
   2S = 80

   \[
   S = 40

1. **First ringing:**

2. **Second ringing:**
   The alarm rang for three times as long as the first time. Since it rang 4 times the first time, it will ring 3 times as long the second time.

82,521,ar,"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables and using the given information to set up equations.

1. Let \( G \) be Grace's weight. According to the problem, \( G = 125 \) pounds.
2. Let \( A \) be Alex's weight. The problem states that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Therefore, we can write the equation for Alex's weight as:
   \[
   A = 4G - 2
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( G \):
   \[
   A = 4 \times 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 478
   \]
   So, Alex's weight is 478 pounds.

3. To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight:
   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = G + A = 125 + 478 = 603
   \]

Thus, their combined weights are 603 pounds.

The final answer is:
\[
603

1. **Contemporary Dance:**
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance.

2. **Jazz Dance:**

   \]
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4

   So, 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance.

3. **Hip-hop Dance:**

1. Determine the number of jelly beans each friend thinks are in the jar.
2. Calculate the sum of these guesses.
3. Divide the sum by the number of friends (which is 3) to get the average.

First, let's determine the guesses:
- The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess: \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \).
- The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess: \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of these guesses:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

Now, divide the sum by the number of friends:
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following system of equations:

\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

45,545,ar,"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

1. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles written on Tuesday is:
   \[
   5 \times 1 + \frac{2}{5} = 5 \times 1.4 = 7
   \]
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of articles written on Wednesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[
5 + 7 + 14 = 26
\]

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[
26 \times 4 = 104
\]

The final answer is:
\[

1. Calculate the amount of water each girl received.
2. Subtract the amount of water the boy received from the total initial amount.

First, let's find out how much water each girl received. Since there are two girls and each received \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water:
\[
\text{Water each girl received} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we add the water received by both girls:
\[
\text{Total water received by both girls} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we subtract the water received by the girls from the initial total:
\[
\text{Water left after girls} = 24 - 8 = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Finally, we subtract the water received by the boy to find the final amount:
\[
\text{Water left after boy} = 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ liters}

1. We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.

3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Sheep with Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep with Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160

Now, we add up the number of sheep each person has to find the total number of sheep.

\[
\text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep with Toulouse} + \text{Sheep with Charleston} + \text{Sheep with Seattle} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

**Step 1: Points scored in the first 20 minutes**
Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

**Step 2: Points scored in the second 20 minutes**
Mike scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point
So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

**Step 3: Total points scored**
To find the total points scored by Mike, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

78,569,ar,"First, let's determine the cost of buying flowers in 3-pack packages:
- Each 3-pack costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent would need \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) 3-packs.
- Total cost with 3-pack packages: \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's determine the cost of buying flowers in 2-pack packages:
- Each 2-pack costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent would need \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) 2-packs.
- Total cost with 2-pack packages: \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, let's compare the two costs:
- Cost with 3-pack packages: $15
- Cost with 2-pack packages: $9

The difference in cost is:
- \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars

Therefore, Vincent saves 6 dollars by buying the flowers in 2-pack packages.

The final numeric result is:

87,569,ar,"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increase in salary for each year.
2. Apply the increases for the next three years.

First, let's find the increase in salary for each year. The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary each year. The initial salary is $600.

\[ \text{Increase per year} = 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \]

Now, we apply this increase for the next three years. The total increase in salary after three years is:

\[ \text{Total increase} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Finally, we add this total increase to the initial salary to find Sylvie's new salary:

\[ \text{New salary} = 600 + 180 = 780 \]

Since the problem asks for her annual salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12:

\[ \boxed{780 \times 12 = 9360 \]",9360,0,

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Each floor has 8 units, and the building has 15 floors.

\[
\text{Total number of units} = 15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Next, we find the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied:

\[
\text{Number of occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:

\[
\text{Number of unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30 units.",30,0,

1. **Cindy's Pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's Pets:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = 4 + 2 = 6

3. **Jan's Pets:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Total Number of Pets:**
   To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has.
   \[

11,601,ar,"To determine the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Adding these costs together gives us the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = \boxed{694",694,0,

1. Identify the square footage of the top level.
2. Calculate the square footage of each level below the top level.
3. Sum the square footage of all levels.
4. Divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average.

Let's start with the given information:
- The top level has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below the top level has half the square footage of the level above it.
- The second level has a square footage of 16 / 2 = 8.
- The third level has a square footage of 8 / 2 = 4.
- The fourth level has a square footage of 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

Finally, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
30 / 4 = 7.5.

The average square footage of a level is:

50,609,ar,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced in a week.
2. Determine the number of dozens of eggs produced in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

1. First, we calculate the total number of eggs produced in a week. Since Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we multiply 252 by 7 (the number of days in a week):
   \[
   252 \times 7 = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]

2. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
   \[
   1764 \div 12 = 147 \text{ dozens/week}
   \]

3. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so the total revenue is:
   \[
   147 \times 2 = 294 \text{ dollars}
   \]

- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each: \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each: \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Total revenue for Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each: \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires on Friday, so there is no revenue from truck tires.

\[ 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \]
So, 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance.

Finally, we find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of contemporary dance and jazz dance students from the total number of students:
\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \]

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of hip-hop dance students by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

24,625,ar,"To find the original price of the book, we need to work backwards from the discounted price. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Step 1: Understand the relationship between the original price and the discounted price.
The discounted price is 75% of the original price because a 25% discount means the price is reduced by 25%. Therefore, the discounted price can be expressed as \( 0.75P \).

Step 2: Set up the equation based on the given information.
We know the discounted price is $19.50, so we can write the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

Step 3: Solve for the original price \( P \).
To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Step 4: Perform the division to find the value of \( P \).
\[ P = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was \(26.00\).",26,0,

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold \( \frac{2x - 6}{2} \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
4. After selling at the orange house, she had \( x - \frac{2x - 6}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Set up the equation to solve for \( x \):
\[ x - \frac{2x - 6}{2} = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{2x - 6}{2} = 5 \]
\[ 2x - 2x + 6 = 10 \]

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the donuts.**
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
\text{Cost of donuts} = 3 \times 68 = 204
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes.**
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
\text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = 2 \times 80 = 160
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes.**
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
\text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = 6 \times 55 = 330

**Step 4: Sum the costs of all the pastries.**
\[
\text{Total cost} = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694

1. **Points in the first 20 minutes:**
   Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

2. **Points in the second 20 minutes:**
   In the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. First, we need to find 25% of 4 points:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, he scores 4 points plus 1 point in the second 20 minutes:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Total points scored:**
   To find the total points scored, we add the points from both 20-minute segments:
   \[
   4 + 5 = 9

Thus, the total points Mike scored is:

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the javelin when not holding the gemstone.
2. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
3. Calculate the difference between the gemstone distance and the dragon's reach.

1. Polly's javelin distance when not holding the gemstone: 400 feet.
2. Polly's javelin distance when holding the gemstone: 3 times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Therefore, \(400 \times 3 = 1200\) feet.
3. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. The difference between the gemstone distance and the dragon's reach is:
   \[
   1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}

3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes in a week.

First, let's calculate the total number of dance classes Judy teaches in a week:
- She teaches 5 dance classes every weekday, so in a week (5 weekdays), she teaches \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dance classes.
- She teaches 8 dance classes on Saturday.
- Total dance classes in a week = \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students = \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Finally, calculate the total amount of money she makes in a week:
- She charges $15 per student, so the total amount = \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).",7425,0,

   - Each serving contains 250 calories.
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings.

2. Determine the remaining calorie limit.
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calorie limit = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. Calculate the number of servings you can consume with the remaining calorie limit.
   - Each serving contains 250 calories.
   - Remaining servings = 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.

4. Convert the remaining servings to grams.
   - Each serving in a 300g bag has 60 grams.
   - Remaining grams = 0.8 servings * 60 grams/serving = 48 grams.

   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   \[
   \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

4. **Total number of gems:**
   - Add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together.
   \[
   \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595
   \]

Thus, the total number of gems in the chest is:

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 per tire: \(6 \times 60 = 360\)
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 per tire: \(4 \times 40 = 160\)
- Total revenue for Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\)

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 per tire: \(12 \times 40 = 480\)
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires: \(0 \times 60 = 0\)
- Total revenue for Friday: \(480 + 0 = 480\)

**Difference in revenue:**
- Revenue on Thursday: $520
- Revenue on Friday: $480

First, let's calculate the expected increase in value for the jewelry:
- The jewelry is worth $5,000.
- The expected market rise for jewelry is 2.5%.
- The increase in value is \(5000 \times 0.025 = 125\).

Next, let's calculate the expected increase in value for the electronic gadgets:
- The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000.
- The expected market rise for electronic gadgets is 1.2%.
- The increase in value is \(8000 \times 0.012 = 96\).

Now, let's find the difference between the increases in value:
- The increase for jewelry is $125.
- The increase for electronic gadgets is $96.
- The difference is \(125 - 96 = 29\).

Therefore, the profit the merchant can maximize by choosing the jewelry is $29.",125,0,

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's find the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.
\[
15 \times 8 = 120
\]
So, the total number of units in the building is 120.

Next, we calculate the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4.
\[
120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90
\]
So, the number of occupied units is 90.

Finally, the number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units.
\[
120 - 90 = 30

1. Calculate Alex's weight.
2. Add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.

First, we know Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex's weight is given as 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. Therefore, we can calculate Alex's weight as follows:

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2
\]

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2
\]

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2
\]

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 478

Next, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight to find their combined weights:

\[
\text{Combined weights} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight}

\[
\text{Combined weights} = 125 + 478

1. **Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing:**
   - Gene started vacationing at age 23.
   - He is currently 34 years old.
   - Number of years = Current age - Starting age
   - Number of years = 34 - 23
   - Number of years = 11

2. **Calculate the total number of vacations Gene has taken:**
   - Gene goes on 4 vacations per year.
   - Total number of vacations = Number of years × Vacations per year
   - Total number of vacations = 11 × 4
   - Total number of vacations = 44

3. **Calculate the number of years of vacations:**
   - Since Gene goes on 4 vacations each year, the number of years of vacations is the same as the number of years he has been vacationing.
   - Number of years of vacations = 11

4. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of quilt blocks is equal to the number of years of vacations.

48,705,ar,"To determine how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches.
2. Divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece.

Step 1: Convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches.
- There are 12 inches in a foot.
- Tracy used 4 feet of wire.
- Therefore, the total length of the wire in inches is:
  \[
  4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
  \]

Step 2: Divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece.
- Each piece of wire is 6 inches long.
- To find the number of pieces, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
  \[
  \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces}
  \]

Thus, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

1. **Determine Raymond's current age:**
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, Raymond is currently \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

2. **Determine the age difference between Raymond and his son:**
   - Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
   - Raymond is currently 25 years old.
   - The age difference between Raymond and his son is \(25 - 23 = 2\) years.

3. **Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born:**
   - Raymond's son is currently 23 years old.
   - The age difference between Raymond and his son is 2 years.
   - Therefore, Raymond's son was born 23 years ago because the age difference is currently 2 years, and the son is currently \(25 - 2 = 23\) years old.

Thus, Raymond's son was born 23 years ago.

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40

   Adding 20 to this gives the second friend's guess:
   \[
   40 + 20 = 60

3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is:

   So the third friend's guess is:
   \[
   80 + 20 = 100

39,729,ar,"First, determine Dana's running speed and walking speed:
- She skips at 3 miles per hour, so her running speed is twice that, which is 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
- Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, which is 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Next, calculate the time she spends running and walking:
- She spends one-third of the time running, which is (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours.
- She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours.

Now, calculate the distance she runs and walks:
- Distance running = speed * time = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
- Distance walking = speed * time = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Finally, add the distances to find the total distance traveled:
- Total distance = 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:

3. **Emeralds:**
   - There are twice the number of emeralds than rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[

The cost of each glass follows this sequence:

There are 8 odd-positioned glasses and 8 even-positioned glasses.

The cost for 8 odd-positioned glasses is $8 \times 5 = 40$.

The cost to plant the tree is $90. Each year, the cost to water and feed the tree is $3. The total cost for each year is:
\[

\]
Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon sells for $1.5. Therefore, the total earnings from selling lemons each year is:
\[
7 \times 1.5 = 10.5

To find out how many years it will take for the earnings to cover the initial cost, we set up the equation:
\[
10.5t - 6t = 90

Simplify the equation:
\[
4.5t = 90

Solve for \( t \):
\[
t = \frac{90}{4.5} = 20

10,753,ar,"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - The number of downloads is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   - First month downloads: 60
   - Second month downloads: \(3 \times 60 = 180\)

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads is reduced by 30% from the second month's number of downloads.
   - Second month downloads: 180
   - Third month downloads: \(180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126\)

Now, we sum the downloads for all three months:
\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is \(366\boxed{}.\)",366,0,

85,753,ar,"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing.
2. Determine the total number of vacations he has taken.
3. Calculate the total number of quilt blocks based on the number of vacations.

1. **Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing:**
   - Gene started vacationing when he was 23 years old.
   - He is now 34 years old.
   - Therefore, the number of years he has been vacationing is \( 34 - 23 = 11 \) years.

2. **Determine the total number of vacations he has taken:**
   - Gene goes on 4 vacations per year.
   - Over 11 years, he has taken \( 4 \times 11 = 44 \) vacations.

3. **Calculate the total number of quilt blocks:**
   - Each vacation results in one quilt block.
   - Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

Thus, the total number of quilt blocks is \(44\).",44,0,

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sprints James runs in a week.**
- James runs 3 sprints each day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the number of sprints in a week is:
  \[
  3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ sprints/week}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance James runs in one sprint.**
- James runs 60 meters each sprint.

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.**
- The total distance is the number of sprints in a week multiplied by the distance run per sprint:
  \[
  21 \text{ sprints/week} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 1260 \text{ meters/week}
  \]

Thus, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:

1. Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.
3. Sum the number of articles written over the three days.
4. Multiply the total number of articles by the average time per article to get the total hours spent.

1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, she wrote \( 5 \times (1 + \frac{2}{5}) = 5 \times 1.4 = 7 \) articles.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.
4. The total number of articles written over the three days is \( 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \) articles.
5. The total number of hours spent writing articles is \( 26 \times 4 = 104 \) hours.

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced in a week.
2. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we find the total number of eggs produced in a week. Since the chickens produce 252 eggs per day, in a week (7 days) they produce:

\[
252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs}
\]

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

\[
\frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens}
\]

Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 147 dozens is:

\[
147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars}

1. Calculate the total time spent watching TV and reading per day.
2. Calculate the total time spent watching TV and reading per week.
3. Calculate the total time spent watching TV and reading in 4 weeks.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time spent watching TV and reading per day.**

Jim watches TV for 2 hours and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. Therefore, the total time spent per day is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time spent watching TV and reading per week.**

Jim does this 3 times a week. Therefore, the total time spent per week is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent watching TV and reading in 4 weeks.**

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   Given that there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we calculate the number of cats as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. First, we find the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   Therefore, there are:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168

1. Calculate the total cost of the house after repairs.
2. Calculate the new value of the house after repairs.
3. Subtract the total cost from the new value to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house after repairs.**

The original cost of the house is $80,000. The repairs cost $50,000.

Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

**Step 2: Calculate the new value of the house after repairs.**

The repairs increase the value of the house by 150%. Therefore, the new value is:

New value = Original cost × Increase factor
New value = $80,000 × 1.5 = $120,000

**Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the new value to find the profit.**

Profit = New value - Total cost

19,809,ar,"First, let's determine the total time Marissa has already spent walking. She walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in another hour. So, the total time spent is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the total distance she has already walked. The first 4 miles took her 1 hour, and the next 2 miles took her another 1 hour. So, the total distance walked is \(4 + 2 = 6\) miles.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is \(12 - 6 = 6\) miles.

To find out how long it will take her to walk the remaining 6 miles, we need to divide the distance by her desired average speed, which is 4 miles per hour. So, the time required is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) hours.

Since time is inversely proportional to speed, the speed required to complete the remaining distance in 1.5 hours is \(1.5 \times 6 = 9\) miles per hour.",6,0,

31,809,ar,"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate each of the guesses and then find the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend guesses:
   \[
   40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend guesses:
   \[
   80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we sum up all the guesses:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of friends:
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar is:
\[
\boxed{80

45,809,ar,"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on each day.**

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
  \[
  5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days.**

\[
5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles.**

Each article takes 4 hours to write. Therefore, the total time spent is:

\[
26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}

97,817,ar,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Therefore, the original volume of the tomatoes is twice the volume of the sauce.

2. **Calculate the original volume of the tomatoes**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is half of the original volume, the original volume of the tomatoes is:
   \[
   2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of cans used**: Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many cans Freda used, we divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of one can:
   \[
   \frac{64}{16} = 4
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used**: Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12
   \]

20,849,ar,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after combining the orange and pineapple drinks, accounting for the spillage.

1. **Calculate the water content in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is 10 liters and two-thirds water.
   - Water content in orange drink = 10 liters * 2/3 = 10 liters.

2. **Calculate the water content in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters and three-fifths water.
   - Water content in pineapple drink = 15 liters * 3/5 = 9 liters.

3. **Account for the spillage:**
   - One liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the remaining orange drink is 9 liters.
   - Water content in the remaining orange drink = 9 liters * 2/3 = 6 liters.

4. **Add the water content from both drinks:**
   - Total water content = 10 liters (orange drink) + 9 liters (pineapple drink) + 6 liters (remaining orange drink) = 25 liters.",15,0,

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

4. **Total Number of Gems:**
   - The total number of gems is the sum of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.
   - Therefore, the total number of gems is:
     \[
     175 + 140 + 280 = 595

1. Let \( A \) be Amy's age.
2. Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
3. Let \( C \) be Corey's age.
4. Let \( M \) be James's age.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:

- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \).
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \).
- James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \).

Given that James is 10 years old:
\[ M = C - 1 \]
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now, we know Corey's age, we can find Amy's age using the second relationship:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

75,857,ar,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average square footage of each level in the sandcastle. Each level has a square footage that is half the square footage of the level below it. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's denote the square footage of the top level as \(S_1\). According to the problem, \(S_1 = 16\).

The square footage of the second level is \(S_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times S_1 = 8\).

The square footage of the third level is \(S_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times S_2 = 4\).

The square footage of the fourth level is \(S_4 = \frac{1}{2} \times S_3 = 2\).

Now, we sum up the square footage of all four levels:

\[
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30
\]

Next, we divide this total by the number of levels to find the average square footage:

\[
\frac{30}{4} = \boxed{7.5",60,0,

The weight of the truck must then be 1245 pounds because the bridge's limit is 5000 pounds and the weight of the truck must be less than 5000 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the driver and the truck is 3755 + 1245 = 5000 pounds. Since this is exactly the bridge's limit, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the limit is the weight of the truck, which is 1245 pounds.

62,873,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension, we need to consider the conditions given:

1. If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000 per year.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she does not qualify for the $50,000 annual pension. Therefore, we need to consider the second part of the pension calculation.

Assuming the total pension value is \( P \), and Marcy receives 5% of the value per year, her annual pension would be:

\[ \text{Annual Pension} = 0.05P \]

However, without the total pension value \( P \), we cannot determine the exact amount of her annual pension. The problem does not provide the total pension value, so we cannot calculate a specific numeric answer.

Since the problem does not provide the total pension value, we cannot determine the exact annual pension. Therefore, we can only state that the problem is incomplete.

1. Identify Grace's weight.
2. Calculate Alex's weight based on the given relationship.
3. Add Grace's and Alex's weights together.

Step 1: Identify Grace's weight.
Grace's weight is given as 125 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate Alex's weight.
We know that Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight.
First, calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds} \]
Then, subtract 2 pounds from this result to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 3: Add Grace's and Alex's weights together.
Now, add Grace's weight and Alex's weight to find their combined weight:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the combined weights of Grace and Alex in pounds are \(623\).",623,0,

   - Carla downloads 2 GB/minute.
   - After 40% of the download, she has downloaded 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.
   - The remaining size to download is 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.
   - Time to download 120 GB at 2 GB/minute = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

2. Add the update time:
   - The update takes 20 minutes.
   - Total download time = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

3. Consider the restart:
   - After the update, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning again.
   - This means she downloads another 20 GB of the file at 2 GB/minute, which takes 20 GB / 2 GB/minute = 10 minutes.
   - Total download time = 10 minutes + 20 minutes (update) = 30 minutes.

74,881,ar,"First, we need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar.

- Marigolds: $2.74 per pot rounded to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 per pot rounded to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 per pot rounded to $2

Next, we calculate the revenue for each type of flower based on the number of pots sold.

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 per pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 per pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 per pot = $34

Finally, we add up the revenues for all types of flowers to find the total revenue.

Total revenue = $36 (marigolds) + $18 (petunias) + $34 (begonias) = $88

Thus, Artie will make $88.",88,0,

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Since the first guess is 80, half of 80 is 40. Therefore, the second friend's guess is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. To find 25% more than 80, we calculate 25% of 80, which is 20. Therefore, the third friend's guess is 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, we sum up all the guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of friends:
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

Thus, the average guess is \(80\).",80,0,

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of all the ties:

\[
\text{Total cost} = (5 \times 40) + (10 \times 60) = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

First, let's calculate her earnings as a teacher:
- She earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week.
- weekly earnings as a teacher = $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week
- annual earnings as a teacher = $700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings as a cheerleading coach:
- She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week.
- weekly earnings as a coach = $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week
- annual earnings as a coach = $450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22500/year

Finally, we add her earnings as a teacher and her earnings as a cheerleading coach to find her total annual salary:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Total number of units = Number of floors × Number of units per floor
- Total number of units = 15 × 8
- Total number of units = 120

**Step 2: Calculate the number of units that are occupied.**
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Number of occupied units = (3/4) × Total number of units
- Number of occupied units = (3/4) × 120
- Number of occupied units = 90

**Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**
- Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units - Number of occupied units
- Number of unoccupied units = 120 - 90
- Number of unoccupied units = 30

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

Let's calculate the total number of DVDs sold to each group:

1. The first 3 customers:

2. The next 2 customers:

   \]

3. The last 3 customers:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 0 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 0 \text{ DVDs}

\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Next, we determine the new value of the house. The value of the house increases by 150% due to the repairs. To find the new value, we calculate:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = 9\]

Now that we have \(x\), we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) years, and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\) years.

The problem asks for Allen's age 10 years from now. Therefore, we need to calculate 10 years plus Allen's current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now will be

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the unoccupied units.

First, we calculate the total number of units in the building:
\[
15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units}
\]

Next, we determine the number of occupied units:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 120 \text{ units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the unoccupied units:
\[
120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units}
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 18 \div 3 = 6 \]
So, 6 packages of 3 are needed. The total cost for these packages is:
\[ 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2. The cost per package of 2 is $1. To find out how many packages of 2 are needed to buy 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]
So, 9 packages of 2 are needed. The total cost for these packages is:
\[ 9 \times 1 = 9 \]

Finally, the savings by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is:

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires.
- Each truck tire costs $60.
- Revenue from truck tires: \( 6 \times 60 = 360 \)
- On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 4 car tires.
- Each car tire costs $40.
- Revenue from car tires: \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \)
- Total revenue for Thursday: \( 360 + 160 = 520 \)

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires.
- Each car tire costs $40.
- Total revenue for Friday: \( 12 \times 40 = 480 \)

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- Difference: \( 520 - 480 = 40 \)

First, calculate the total number of players per school:
- Each team has 5 players.
- There are 2 teams per school.
- \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players/school}\)

Next, calculate the total number of people per school, including players and coaches:
- Each team has 1 coach.
- There are 2 teams per school.
- \(10 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} + 2 \text{ coaches} = 22 \text{ people/school}\)

Finally, calculate the total number of people sent by all 4 schools:

1. Calculate the distance James runs in one week.
2. Multiply the distance by the number of weeks (1 week).

First, let's calculate the distance James runs in one week:

- James runs 3 sprints each time.
- Each sprint is 60 meters long.
- He runs 3 times a week.

So, the total distance in one week is:

\[ = 3 \times 60 \times 3 \]
\[ = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Next, since we need the total distance for one week, we multiply the distance by 1 week:
\[ 540 \text{ meters/week} \times 1 \text{ week} \]
\[ = 540 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week.",540,0,

2. Determine the cost of each red tie.
3. Calculate the total cost of the red ties.

First, we know John spends $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
\[

\]

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie.
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 \times 1.5 = 60

51,969,ar,"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we first need to calculate the distance he travels from 1 PM to 4 PM.

Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. He is sailing for 3 hours.

The distance traveled can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we use the speed of 6 miles per hour to find the time it takes him to travel back to the same location.

The time taken to travel back can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

4,985,ar,"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed required for all chickens in a day.
2. Subtract the amounts of feed already given in the morning and afternoon.

First, calculate the total amount of feed required for all chickens in a day:
- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed.
- There are 20 chickens.
- Therefore, the total amount of feed required is:
  \[
  20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, subtract the amounts of feed already given in the morning and afternoon:
- Feed given in the morning: 15 cups
- Feed given in the afternoon: 25 cups
- Therefore, the amount of feed needed in the final meal is:
  \[
  60 \text{ cups} - 15 \text{ cups} - 25 \text{ cups} = 10 \text{ cups}
  \]

1. Calculate the total distance Sophia traveled.
2. Determine the amount of gas she used.
3. Calculate the total amount of gas in the tank.
4. Determine how many miles she can drive on a single gallon of gas.

1. The problem states that Sophia traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank.
2. She used 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank again, which means she used 4 gallons of gas.
3. The total amount of gas in the tank is given as 12 gallons.
4. To find out how many miles she can drive on a single gallon of gas, we need to divide the total distance she traveled by the amount of gas she used:
   \[
   \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total gas used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}

1. Calculate the number of boys.
2. Determine the total number of students.
3. Determine the number of teachers based on the given ratio of students to teachers.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of boys.**

Given:
- There are 60 girls.
- There are twice as many boys as girls.

Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 × 60 = 120

**Step 2: Determine the total number of students.**

Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of students = 60 + 120 = 180

**Step 3: Determine the number of teachers.**

Given:
- There are 5 students to every teacher.

Number of teachers = Total number of students ÷ 5
Number of teachers = 180 ÷ 5 = 36

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is \(36\).",36,0,

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) packages.
- The cost for 6 packages is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) packages.
- The cost for 9 packages is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

The difference in cost is \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.",6,0,

2. Determine the combined number of dogs and cats.

4. Sum the number of all pets (dogs, cats, and rabbits).

Given:
- Number of dogs = 60
- Number of cats = 2 \times Number of dogs = 2 \times 60 = 120

Now, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
- Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Next, we find the number of rabbits:
- Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168

Finally, we sum the number of all pets:
- Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

45,1009,ar,"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.
3. Sum the total number of articles written over the three days.
4. Multiply the total number of articles by the average time per article.

First, let's calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday:
- Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles.

Next, calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday:
- On Wednesday, she wrote \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles.

Now, sum the total number of articles written over the three days:
- Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26.

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, so the total number of hours spent is:
- Total hours = 26 articles \(\times\) 4 hours per article = 104 hours.",104,0,

78,1017,ar,"To determine which pricing option is better, we need to calculate the total cost for 18 flowers under each option and then compare the costs.

1. **Option 1: Packages of 3 flowers**
   - Vincent needs 18 flowers.
   - Cost per package of 3 flowers: $2.50
   - Number of packages needed: \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\)
   - Total cost: \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars

2. **Option 2: Packages of 2 flowers**
   - Vincent needs 18 flowers.
   - Cost per package of 2 flowers: $1
   - Number of packages needed: \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\)
   - Total cost: \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars

Now, we compare the total costs:
- Option 1: $15
- Option 2: $9

The difference in cost is:
\[ 15 - 9 = 6 \]

Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.",6,0,
