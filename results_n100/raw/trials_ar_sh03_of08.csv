47,3,ar,"First, we need to determine the number of blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 \times 1.5 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the costs of the red and blue ties:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \boxed{800",800,0,

63,11,ar,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost for the first half of the year and the cost for the second half of the year.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - The first half of the year has 6 months.
   - Total cost for the first half: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The monthly charge for the second half is 10% less than $140.
   - This means the monthly charge is \( 140 - 140 \times 0.10 = 126 \) dollars.
   - The second half of the year has 6 months.
   - Total cost for the second half: \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Total cost: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

1. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock each day.
2. Determine the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals.
3. Subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed to find the amount of feed left for the final meal.

First, calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock each day:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups per chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, determine the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed:

First, let's calculate her earnings for the weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes from Monday to Friday.

- Over 5 days, she teaches \(5 \times 15 = 75\) students.
- She charges $15.00 per student, so her earnings for weekdays are \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students, so she teaches \(8 \times 15 = 120\) students.
- She charges $15.00 per student, so her earnings for Saturday are \(120 \times 15 = 1800\) dollars.

4. The total cost for the red ties is:
   \[
   10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

5. Adding the costs of the blue and red ties gives the total amount spent on ties:
   \[
   200 + 600 = 800

\[ 180 \text{ days (first half)} + 180 \text{ days (second half)} = 360 \text{ days} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the second half of the year:

Finally, let's add the amounts from both periods:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats and bakes.
3. Determine how many eggs are left for sale.
4. Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks per day.**

The total number of eggs laid per day is 16.

**Step 2: Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats and bakes.**

Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for muffins. So, the number of eggs left is:
\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many eggs are left for sale.**

The number of eggs left for sale is 9.

**Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs.**

Each egg is sold for $2. So, the total revenue from selling 9 eggs is:

66,67,ar,"To determine the total number of people sent by all four schools at the basketball tournament, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of players per team:**
   - Each team has 5 players.

2. **Calculate the number of teams per school:**
   - Each school has 2 teams (one girls’ team and one boys’ team).

3. **Calculate the number of coaches per school:**
   - Each team has 1 coach.

4. **Calculate the total number of people per school:**
   - Players per school = 2 teams * 5 players per team = 10 players
   - Coaches per school = 2 teams * 1 coach per team = 2 coaches
   - Total people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

5. **Calculate the total number of people sent by all four schools:**
   - Number of schools = 4
   - Total people sent = 12 people per school * 4 schools = 48 people

Thus, the total number of people sent by all four schools is \(48\).",48,0,

19,75,ar,"1. Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire trail.
2. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles.
3. She has already walked 4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour.
4. This means she has walked a total of 4 + 2 = 6 miles.
5. Therefore, she still needs to walk 12 - 6 = 6 miles.
6. To maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire trail, she needs to complete the trail in \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) hours.
7. She has already walked 2 hours in the first 6 miles.
8. Thus, the remaining time she has for the 6 miles is \( 48 - 2 = 46 \) hours.
9. To find her speed for the remaining distance, she needs to divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: \( \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{46 \text{ hours}} = \frac{3}{23} \) miles per hour.

\boxed{\frac{3}{23}}",6,0,

1. Identify the starting point and the positions of the stops.
2. Calculate the distance from the starting point to the first stop.
3. Calculate the distance from the first stop to the second stop.
4. Find the difference between the two distances.

Let's go through each step:

1. The starting point is at mile 0.
2. The first stop is at mile 20.
3. The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, which is \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.
4. The distance from the starting point to the first stop is \(20 - 0 = 20\) miles.
5. The distance from the first stop to the second stop is \(45 - 20 = 25\) miles.
6. The total distance traveled between the first and second stops is \(45 - 20 = 25\) miles.

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(25\).",25,0,

1. Determine the guesses of each friend.
2. Add the guesses together.
3. Divide the total by the number of friends to get the average.

**Step 1: Determine the guesses of each friend.**

- First friend: 80 jelly beans
- Second friend: 20 more than half the first friend's guess
  \[
  \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
  \]
- Third friend: 25% more than the first friend's guess
  \[
  80 \times 1.25 = 100
  \]

**Step 2: Add the guesses together.**

\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240

**Step 3: Divide the total by the number of friends to get the average.**

\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80

1. **Initial Pension Calculation:**
   - If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.

2. **Pension Calculation After 20 Years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of her pension per year.
   - First, let's find the value of her pension at 20 years. Since her initial pension for 40 years is $50,000, she has already worked for 20 years.
   - Therefore, her pension value at 20 years is $50,000.

3. **Annual Pension Calculation:**
   - Marcy is entitled to 5% of her pension value per year.
   - 5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2500

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be 2500.",25000,0,

1. Calculate Sylvie's initial annual salary.
2. Determine the annual increase in salary.
3. Calculate the total increase over three years.
4. Add the total increase to her initial salary to find her new salary.

Step 1: Calculate Sylvie's initial annual salary.
Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600, so her initial annual salary is:
\[ 600 \times 12 = 7200 \]

Step 2: Determine the annual increase in salary.
The annual increase is 10% of the initial salary:
\[ 7200 \times 0.10 = 720 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total increase over three years.
\[ 720 \times 3 = 2160 \]

Step 4: Add the total increase to her initial salary to find her new salary.
\[ 7200 + 2160 = 9360 \]

First, calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Total cost for shorts = $3 \times 16.50 = $49.50.

Next, calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Total cost for pants = $3 \times 22.50 = $67.50.

Finally, calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Total cost for shoes = $3 \times 42 = $126.

Now, sum the costs of all the clothing items to find the total amount spent:
Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126

41,115,ar,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone and then find out how far this new throw distance is outside the reach of the dragon's flames.

1. Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
2. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
3. Therefore, the new throw distance with the gemstone is:
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. The dragon's flames have a reach of 1000 feet.
5. To find out how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the reach of the dragon's flames from the new throw distance:
   \[
   1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.",200,0,

\[
60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, calculate the distance he drives in the second segment:
\[
30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}
\]

Then, calculate the distance he drives in the third segment:
\[
80 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ miles}
\]

Add the distances of all three segments to find the total distance he has traveled:
\[
180 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 40 \text{ miles} = 235 \text{ miles}
\]

Since he turns around and does not continue to drive towards home, he is 235 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

Thus, the final numeric result is:

1. **First friend's guess:**
   - The first friend says 80 jelly beans.

2. **Second friend's guess:**
   - The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess.
   - Half of 80 is 40.
   - Therefore, the second friend's guess is \(40 + 20 = 60\).

3. **Third friend's guess:**
   - The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess.
   - 25% of 80 is 20.
   - Therefore, the third friend's guess is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we find the average of these guesses:
\[
\frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is \(80\).",80,0,

\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we know John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The total cost for the red ties is:

\[
10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent:

\[
200 + 600 = 800

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants, and each pair costs $22.50.
\[
3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
\]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes, and each pair costs $42.
\[
3 \times 42 = 126
\]

Now, we sum the costs of all the clothing items:
\[
49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243
\]

Thus, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is:
\[

1. **Determine Gerald's original running time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original running time is:
     \[
     38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the improvement in Gerald's running time:**
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement in 40 seconds is:
     \[
     0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Determine Gerald's new running time:**
   - Subtract the improvement from Gerald's original running time:
     \[
     40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.",36,0,

68,147,ar,"To determine the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of girls:**
   The problem states there are 60 girls at the school.

2. **Calculate the number of boys:**
   Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of students:**
   The total number of students is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of teachers:**
   We are given that there are 5 students to every teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers can be calculated by dividing the total number of students by 5:
   \[
   \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

1. **James's Age**: We know that James is 10 years old.

2. **Corey's Age**: James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey's age is:
   \[
   \text{Corey's age} = \text{James's age} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11

3. **Amy's Age**: Corey is 2 years older than Amy. Therefore, Amy's age is:
   \[
   \text{Amy's age} = \text{Corey's age} - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9

1. **Number of Dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Number of Cats:**
   There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[

2. Calculate the total number of jelly beans.
3. Find the average by dividing the total by the number of friends.

First, let's determine the number of jelly beans each friend has:
- The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's number: \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80 \).
- The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's number: \( 0.25 \times 80 + 80 = 20 + 80 = 100 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of jelly beans:
\[ 80 + 80 + 100 = 260 \]

Finally, we find the average:
\[ \frac{260}{3} = 80 \]

First, let's find out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[
2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}

Next, we know that 4 yogurts cost $5.00. Therefore, the cost per yogurt is:
\[
\frac{5.00}{4} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per yogurt}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:

1. Calculate the number of blue ties John bought.
2. Determine the number of red ties John bought.
3. Calculate the cost of the red ties.
4. Find the total cost of all the ties.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.
\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5 \text{ blue ties}
\]

Next, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties}
\]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
\[
40 \times 1.5 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total cost of the red ties is:
\[
10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, the total amount John spent on all the ties is:
\[
200 + 600 = 800 \text{ dollars}

After eating 2 lollipops, Jean has 28 lollipops remaining. Next, we need to determine how many bags she can fill, with each bag containing 2 lollipops:

1. **Total Years of Work**: Marcy has worked for a total of 30 years.
2. **Pension Calculation**:
   - For the first 20 years, she receives an annual pension of $50,000.
   - For the next 10 years (from 21 to 30 years), she receives 5% of her annual pension.

Let's calculate the pension for these 10 years:

- Annual pension for the next 10 years = 5% of $50,000
- Annual pension for the next 10 years = $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500

Now, let's sum up the annual pension for the first 20 years and the next 10 years:

- Total annual pension = $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500

Thus, her annual pension will be 52500",25000,0,

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know there are two cats for every dog.
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of cats and dogs:**
   - The number of cats is 60.
   - The number of dogs is 120.
   - The combined number of cats and dogs is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

1. The first 3 customers each buy 1 DVD.

   3 \text{ customers} \times 1 \text{ DVD/customer} = 3 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

2. The next 2 customers each buy 2 DVDs.
   \[
   2 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 4 \text{ DVDs}

3. The last 3 customers do not buy any DVDs.
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 0 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 0 \text{ DVDs}

Now, we sum the number of DVDs sold to each group:

First, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, we need 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- Therefore, the cost is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, we need 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- Therefore, the cost is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost of 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.

The better package is the one that costs $9. Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.",6,0,

82,187,ar,"To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we need to calculate Alex's weight first. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Let's denote Grace's weight by \( G \) and Alex's weight by \( A \).

Given:
- \( G = 125 \) pounds
- Alex's weight can be calculated as \( A = 4G - 2 \)

First, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
\[ 4G = 4 \times 125 = 500 \]

Next, we subtract 2 pounds from this result to find Alex's weight:
\[ A = 500 - 2 = 498 \]

Now that we know Alex's weight is 498 pounds, we can find their combined weights by adding Grace's weight to Alex's weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = G + A = 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Therefore, their combined weights in pounds is \(623\).",623,0,

97,187,ar,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used for her last batch of sauce, we need to account for the volume loss during cooking and the number of tomatoes per can.

First, let's understand the volume loss. When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Therefore, the volume of the sauce Freda made is 32 ounces. This means that before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes must have been:

\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16-ounce cans Freda used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is:

\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

1. Calculate the number of boys.
2. Calculate the total number of students.
3. Determine the number of teachers based on the given ratio of students to teachers.

First, let's find the number of boys. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120

Next, we calculate the total number of students:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180
\]

Now, we know that there are 5 students to every teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers is:
\[
\text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

52,211,ar,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we start by calculating the total weight of the comic books he removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. After removing the comic books, he still needs to remove:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, we need to find out how many toys are required to remove 7.5 pounds. This can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. Therefore, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

\[

1. Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.
3. Determine the total number of articles written over the three days.
4. Calculate the total time spent writing.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.**
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.**
On Wednesday, she wrote \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles.

**Step 3: Determine the total number of articles written over the three days.**
Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26.

**Step 4: Calculate the total time spent writing.**
Each article takes 4 hours to write. Therefore, the total time spent is \(26 \times 4 = 104\) hours.

Next, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{1764}{12} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the eggs per week is:

Sylvie has been with the company for 5 years, so her initial annual salary is $7200. After the first year, her salary increases by 10% of $7200. Therefore, her salary after one year is:

\[
7200 + 7200 \times 0.10 = 7200 + 720 = 7920

After the second year, her salary increases by 10% of $7920. Therefore, her salary after two years is:

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings as a teacher:
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She earns $20 per hour.
\[
\text{Weekly teacher earnings} = 35 \times 20 = 700
\]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings as a cheerleading coach:
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She earns $30 per hour.
\[
\text{Weekly coach earnings} = 15 \times 30 = 450
\]

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = 700 + 450 = 1150
\]

Finally, let's calculate her annual salary by multiplying her weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a year:
\[
\text{Annual salary} = 1150 \times 50 = 57500
\]

1. **Cindy's Pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's Pets:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6

   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18

Now, we sum the number of pets each person has:

\[
\text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28

Step 1: Calculate the regular hours and overtime hours.
- Eliza worked 45 hours in total.
- Regular hours are the first 40 hours.
- Overtime hours are the remaining hours after regular hours.
- Overtime hours = 45 - 40 = 5 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the earnings from regular hours.
- Her regular hourly rate is $10.
- Earnings from regular hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

Step 3: Calculate the earnings from overtime hours.
- Her overtime hourly rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour.
- Earnings from overtime hours = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Step 4: Calculate the total earnings for the week.
- Total earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime hours = $400 + $60 = $460.

1. Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.
3. Sum the total number of articles written over the three days.
4. Calculate the total hours spent writing articles.

First, calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Articles on Tuesday} = \left( 1 + \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 5 = \left( \frac{7}{5} \right) \times 5 = 7 \]

Next, calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday:
\[ \text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, sum the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ \text{Total articles} = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Finally, calculate the total hours spent writing articles:

1. Calculate the number of blue ties John bought.
2. Determine the cost of the red ties.
3. Calculate the total cost of the red ties.
4. Add the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is:
\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he buys:
\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties}
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie, which is:
\[
40 \times 1.5 = 60
\]

The total cost of the red ties is:
\[
10 \times 60 = 600

   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday.
   - \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) classes.

2. Calculate the number of classes Judy teaches on Saturday:
   - Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.

3. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
   - Total classes = Classes on weekdays + Classes on Saturday
   - Total classes = \( 25 + 8 = 33 \).

4. Calculate the total number of students in a week:
   - Each class has 15 students.
   - Total students = Total classes × Students per class
   - Total students = \( 33 \times 15 = 495 \).

5. Calculate the total money Judy makes in a week:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones.
2. Add the interest to the total cost.
3. Divide the total cost including interest by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750
\]

Next, we calculate the interest for each cell phone:
\[
\text{Interest per cell phone} = 150 \times 0.02 = 3
\]

There are 5 cell phones, so the total interest is:
\[
\text{Total interest} = 5 \times 3 = 15
\]

Now, we find the total amount to be paid:
\[
\text{Total amount to be paid} = 750 + 15 = 765

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine the number of dozens in the weekly egg production.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week.

\[
252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}

**Step 2: Determine the number of dozens in the weekly egg production.**

1 dozen equals 12 eggs.

\[
\frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens/week}

\[
5 \times 150 = 750
\]

Next, we need to calculate the interest for each cell phone. Since the interest rate is 2% and it is charged over a 3-month period, we need to find the interest per month:

\[
\text{Interest rate per month} = \frac{2\%}{3} = 0.67\%
\]

Now, let's calculate the interest for one cell phone:

\[
\text{Interest per cell phone} = 150 \times 0.0067 = 1.05
\]

Since Shiela has five cell phones, the total interest for all five units is:

\[
5 \times 1.05 = 5.25
\]

Finally, to find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we divide the total interest by 3:

\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{5.25}{3} = 1.75

2. Determine the number of cats based on the given ratio.
3. Calculate the number of rabbits based on the given relationship.
4. Sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to get the total number of pets.

Step 1: The number of dogs is given as 60.

Step 2: The problem states that there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

Step 3: The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\). Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

Step 4: The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. This is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

Next, we calculate the time Dana spends running. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, the time spent running is:

- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

Next, calculate the total distance Marissa has walked:
- She walked 4 miles in the first hour.
- She walked 2 miles in the next hour.
Total distance walked = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.

To find her average speed, we use the formula Average speed = Total distance / Total time.
Given:
- Total distance = 12 miles
- Total time = 2 hours
- Average speed = 4 miles per hour

The remaining distance = 12 miles - Total distance walked = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

We know that average speed is 4 miles per hour for the entire 6 miles, so we need to find the speed for the first 2 miles:
Speed = Remaining distance / Total time = 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Total spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160
\]

Next, we add the $5 he has left to the total spent on video games to find the total amount of money he received from selling his lego sets:

\[
\text{Total money received from selling lego sets} = 160 + 5 = 165
\]

Since John initially had 13 lego sets and sold all of them, we can verify the total money received:

\[
\text{Total money received from selling lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195
\]

However, this calculation indicates that John did not receive enough money to buy 8 video games for $20 each, leaving him with a $5 difference. This suggests a",2,0,

\[ \text{Cost for the first half} = 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, let's find the cost for the second half of the year. The streaming company charges her 10% less than the initial amount for the second half. Therefore, the monthly charge for the second half is:

\[ 140 - (0.1 \times 140) = 140 - 14 = 126 \]

Since the second half also consists of 6 months, the cost for the second half is:

\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we add the costs from both halves of the year to find the total amount paid:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

3. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

Let's calculate the number of blue ties John bought:
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie's cost:
\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

The puppy consumes 1 cup per day for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

The puppy consumes 2 cups per day for the remaining days:

2. For the first half of the year (6 months), she paid the full amount of $140 per month. 
   \[
   140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars}

3. For the second half of the year (6 months), she paid 10% less than the initial amount.
   First, calculate 10% of $140:
   \[
   140 \times 0.10 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, the charge per month for the second half of the year is:
   \[
   140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars}

4. Therefore, for 6 months, the amount paid is:

First, we know that Sophia traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Gallons used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg}
\]

Now, we know the owner's manual says the car's tank holds 12 gallons. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of gas, we multiply the fuel efficiency by the capacity of the tank:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Fuel efficiency} \times \text{Tank capacity} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   The combined number of dogs and cats is:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168

3. Divide the sum by the number of friends.

First, let's determine the guesses:
- The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses 20 more than half the first friend's guess:
  \[
  \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60

- The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess:
  \[

Next, we sum these guesses:
\[

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the remaining 180 days.

Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
\text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = 2 \times 80 = 160
\]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
\text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = 6 \times 55 = 330
\]

Finally, we sum up all the costs to find the total cost:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week.
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

**Step 2: Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.**

There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2.

1. Determine Alex's weight.
2. Add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.

**Step 1: Determine Alex's weight.**

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. We know Grace weighs 125 pounds.

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2
\]

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2
\]

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2
\]

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 478 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.**

\[
\text{Combined weights} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight}

\[

1. **Cost of shorts:**
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs
   - Total cost for shorts: \( 3 \times 16.50 = 49 \) dollars

2. **Cost of pants:**
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs
   - Total cost for pants: \( 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \) dollars

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs
   - Total cost for shoes: \( 3 \times 42 = 126 \) dollars

Henry's second stop is 15 miles before the end of his trip, which is 60 miles long. Therefore, the distance from the start to the second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Step 2: Identify the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.
Henry's first stop is after 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ miles} \]

58,379,ar,"Stephen's final bill for groceries is $40.00. The delivery fee is 25% of this total, so it is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Delivery fee} = 25\% \times 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
\]

Adding the delivery fee to the original total gives:

\[
\text{Total with delivery fee} = 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00
\]

Next, the delivery vendor charges $3.00 in delivery fees. Adding this to the total:

\[
\text{Total with tip} = 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00
\]

Finally, Stephen adds a $4.00 tip:

\[
\text{Final price of groceries} = 53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00
\]

Thus, the final price of Stephen's groceries, after the extra fees, is:

1. Calculate the number of servings Cynthia eats in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream are needed based on the number of servings.
3. Calculate the total cost of the cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of servings Cynthia eats in 60 days.**
Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream are needed.**
Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60}{15} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the cartons.**
Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts, and each dozen costs $68.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the donuts cost $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and each dozen costs $80.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]
So, the mini cupcakes cost $160.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, and each dozen costs $55.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330

First, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot ( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 ) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners left.
We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so \( \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \).
Adding 1 to both sides gives \( \frac{x}{3} = 6 \).
Multiplying both sides by 3 gives \( x = 18 \).

1. **Seattle's Sheep Count:**
   - We are given that Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep Count:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep Count:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

4. **Total Number of Sheep:**
   - To find the total number of sheep in all three cities, we add the number of sheep in each city:
     \[
     20 \text{ (Seattle)} + 80 \text{ (Charleston)} + 160 \text{ (Toulouse)} = 260

\[
\frac{6 + x}{2 + x} = 4
\]
Multiplying both sides by \( 2 + x \), we get:
\[
6 + x = 4(2 + x)
\]
Expanding the right side, we get:
\[
6 + x = 8 + 4x
\]
Subtracting \( x \) from both sides, we get:
\[
6 = 8 + 3x
\]
Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:
\[
-2 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[
x = -\frac{2}{3}

11,411,ar,"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[ \text{Cost of donuts} = 3 \times 68 = 204 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[ \text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[ \text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = 6 \times 55 = 330 \]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the pastries to get the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \]

90,411,ar,"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we will break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the total potato salad consumption for both the adult and children dinosaurs.

1. **Calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults:**
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs.
   - There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
   - Total consumption for adults = \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs.

2. **Calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:**
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult.
   - Each child dinosaur eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs.
   - There are 5 child dinosaurs.
   - Total consumption for children = \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) lbs.

3. **Calculate the total potato salad consumption for all dinosaurs:**
   - Total consumption = \( 200 + 25 = 225 \) lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

72,427,ar,"To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the revenue from selling brownies and the revenue from selling cheesecakes separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling brownies:
- Each brownie is sold for $3.
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Therefore, the revenue from brownies is:
  \[
  43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes:
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Therefore, the revenue from cheesecakes is:
  \[
  23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we sum the revenues from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money raised:
\[
129 \text{ dollars} + 92 \text{ dollars} = 221 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we find the number of girls in Grade 5. The total number of students is 200, so the number of girls is:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. To find the number of girls in the Girl Scouts, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of girls in Girl Scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Finally, we find the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts by subtracting the number of girls in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls:

\[
\text{Number of girls not in Girl Scouts} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

1. **Total cars initially:**
   There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam:**
   5 cars took an exit and didn't drive through the traffic jam.

3. **Cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes:**
   20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

4. **Total cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam initially:**
   5 cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam initially must be accounted for.

5. **Cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes:**
   Since the cars that drove through the traffic jam initially are the remaining cars that didn't take the exit:
   \[
   \text{Cars that drove through the traffic jam initially} = 30 - 5 = 25
   \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25",5,0,

1. **Initial Pension for 40 Years:**
   - If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000 per year.

2. **Starting After 20 Years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the pension per year.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

- For the first 20 years, she receives the full pension of $50,000 per year.
- For the next 10 years, she receives 5% of her full pension per year.

So, calculate:
- $50,000/year for 20 years = $100,000
- $50,000/year for 10 years * 5% = $25,000

Add these together:
$100,000 + $25,000 = $125,000.",25000,0,

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
2. Calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens.

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire eats in one week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast, and there are 7 days in a week, we have:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.",7,0,

62,459,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we need to consider the conditions given in the problem.

1. If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Since Marcy works for 30 years instead of 40, she is eligible for the reduced pension starting after 20 years. Therefore, we need to calculate her pension for the first 20 years and the last 10 years separately.

- For the first 20 years, she gets the full pension of $50,000 per year.
- For the last 10 years, she gets 5% of the pension value.

The reduced pension value for the last 10 years is:
\[
50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500
\]

Thus, her annual pension when quitting after 30 years is $2500.",25000,0,

65,459,ar,"To determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Daily Spending:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours.
   - He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

2. **Total Daily Spending:**
   - Total daily spending = Time spent watching TV + Time spent reading
   - Total daily spending = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

3. **Weekly Spending:**
   - Jim does this 3 times a week.
   - Total weekly spending = Total daily spending × Number of days per week
   - Total weekly spending = 3 hours/day × 3 days/week = 9 hours/week

4. **Monthly Spending:**
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Total monthly spending = Total weekly spending × Number of weeks
   - Total monthly spending = 9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 36 hours.",36,0,

92,467,ar,"To determine Jackson's age, we need to follow the given relationships between the ages of Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James.

1. **James's Age**: We are given that James is 10 years old.

2. **Amy's Age**: Amy is 1 year younger than Corey. Since Amy is 2 years younger than Amy, Corey's age is:
   \[
   \text{Corey's age} = \text{James's age} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]
   Therefore, Amy's age is:
   \[
   \text{Amy's age} = \text{Corey's age} - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

3. **Jackson's Age**: Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson's age is:
   \[
   \text{Jackson's age} = \text{Amy's age} - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4
   \]

Thus, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is:

41,475,ar,"To determine how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the javelin when not holding the gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
3. Determine the difference between the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone and the distance from which the dragon's flames can reach.

1. Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone.
2. When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, she can throw the javelin \(3 \times 400 = 1200\) feet.
3. The dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside of the reach of the dragon's flames, we subtract the reach of the dragon's flames from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone: \(1200 - 1000 = 200\).",200,0,

1. Identify the number of diamonds.
2. Calculate the number of rubies.
3. Calculate the number of emeralds.
4. Sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems.

1. The number of diamonds is given as 175.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   \[
   \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]
4. Add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems.
   \[
   \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595

1. **Marigolds:**
   - Price per pot: $2.74
   - Number of pots sold: 12
   - Revenue from marigolds: \(2.74 \times 12 = 32.88\)

2. **Petunias:**

97,483,ar,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes needed before cooking:**
   - Freda's sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When tomatoes are cooked, they lose half their volume.
   - Therefore, the volume of tomatoes needed before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - \( V_{\text{raw}} = 2 \times 32 = 64 \) ounces.

2. **Calculate the number of 16-ounce cans needed:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - The number of cans needed is the total volume of tomatoes divided by the volume of one can.
   - \( \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64}{16} = 4 \) cans.

3. **Determine the total number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - The total number of tomatoes is the number of cans multiplied by the number of tomatoes per can.
   - \( \text{Total tomatoes} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \).

99,491,ar,"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. She receives 18 new potted plants. She plans to give away 1 potted plant from each ledge. First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants she initially has:

\[ 40 \text{ ledges} \times 2 \text{ plants per ledge} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Adding the new potted plants:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary gives away 1 potted plant from each ledge. Since there are 40 ledges, the number of potted plants she gives away is:

\[ 40 \text{ ledges} \times 1 \text{ plant per ledge} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary remains with is:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Next, determine how much of the file she downloads during the restart:

Since she downloads 2 GB per minute during the restart, calculate the time required for her to download the 80 GB:

Add the time it took to download the first 80 GB and the time it took to restart and continue downloading:

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**

   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \(3 \times 60 = 180\).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - To find the number of downloads in the third month, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180.
   - The number of downloads in the third month is \(180 - 0.30 \times 180 = 180 - 54 = 126\).

\[
\frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ miles per day}

Next, we need to determine the total number of hours John runs in a week. We know he runs 3 hours the first day and half as much each of the other two days. Therefore, the number of hours he runs each day is:

Since he runs 3 days a week, the total number of hours he runs in a week is:

\[

\]

So, the estimated value of the jewelry is:

\[
5000 + 125 = 5125

\]

So, the estimated value of the electronic gadgets is:

\[

\[ 250 \text{ calories/serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we know that the daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calorie limit is:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Since a 300g bag of chips contains 1250 calories, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat to consume 200 calories. We can set up a proportion:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs per week.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[
252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}
\]

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[
\frac{1764}{12} = 147 \text{ dozen/week}
\]

Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

2. Determine the miles per gallon (mpg) using the total miles traveled and the total gallons of gas used.
3. Calculate the miles that can be driven on the full tank by multiplying the miles per gallon by the total gallons of gas in the tank.

1. Sophia used 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank again.
2. She traveled 100 miles in these 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, the miles per gallon (mpg) is:

\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3}
\]

First, let's add the guesses:

\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

Now, divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is \(80\).",80,0,

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats and uses for her friends from the total number of eggs.
3. Calculate how many eggs are left to sell at the farmers' market.
4. Determine the revenue from selling the eggs at the farmers' market.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day:
\[ 16 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, subtract the number of eggs Janet eats and uses for her friends:
\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, Janet has 9 eggs left to sell at the farmers' market.

Since she sells each fresh duck egg for $2, the revenue from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/egg} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.",18,0,

1. **Cost of the material:**
   Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch.

2. **Cost of the jeweler:**
   Janet pays $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Insurance cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost of the material and the jeweler to get the brooch insured. First, we calculate the total cost of the material and the jeweler:
   \[
   500 + 800 = 1300
   \]
   Now, we calculate 10% of this total:
   \[
   0.10 \times 1300 = 130
   \]

Now, we sum up all the expenses:
\[
500 + 800 + 130 = 1430

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   \[
   \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems.
\[
\text{Total gems} = \text{Number of diamonds} + \text{Number of rubies} + \text{Number of emeralds} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595

In total, this brings him \(180 + 180 = 360\) miles.

He then tries to drive home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he does not travel any distance during this time.

52,555,ar,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we start by calculating the total weight of the comic books he removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing 7.5 pounds of comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys are needed to remove 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:

\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final answer is:

\[

1. **Marigolds**: 
   - Price per pot: $2.74

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has initially.
2. Determine how many potted plants she will give away.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants.

First, let's find the total number of potted plants Mary has initially:
- She received 18 new potted plants.
- She already had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to \(2 \times 40 = 80\) potted plants.
- Adding these together gives \(18 + 80 = 98\) potted plants.

Next, let's determine how many potted plants she will give away:
- She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to 40 potted plants.

Finally, we subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants:
\[
98 - 40 = 58

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \(6 \times 55 = 330\).

- For the orange drink:

  \]

- For the pineapple drink:
  \[
  \text{Water from pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
  \]

Next, since I spill one liter of the orange drink, the total amount of water from the orange drink is now:
\[
6 - 1 = 5 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, let's add the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink together:
\[
5 + 9 = 14 \text{ liters}

Finally, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. Since the total water from both drinks is 14 liters, the remaining 24 liters contain no water.

1. **Cindy's pets:**
   - Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's pets:**
   - Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   - Therefore, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

3. **Jan's pets:**
   - Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   - Therefore, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of pets each person has:

\[
\text{Total pets} = \text{Jan's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Cindy's pets}
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Total pets} = 18 + 6 + 4 = 28

- Total cost for shorts = 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

Next, calculate the cost of the pants:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x\), we can find Allen's current age. Allen's age is \(11x\), so:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age now is 99. To find his age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109.",109,0,
31,603,ar,"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate each guess and then find the mean of these guesses.

1. **First Friend's Guess:**
   - The first friend says 80 jelly beans.

2. **Second Friend's Guess:**
   - The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
   - Half of 80 is 40.
   - Therefore, the second friend says \(40 + 20 = 60\) jelly beans.

3. **Third Friend's Guess:**
   - The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess.
   - 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\).
   - Therefore, the third friend says \(80 + 20 = 100\) jelly beans.

Now, we find the average of these guesses:
\[
\frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

33,611,ar,"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
2. According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins can be expressed as \( S + 30 \).
3. The total number of coins Gretchen has is 110. This can be written as the sum of the silver coins and the gold coins:
   \[
   S + (S + 30) = 110
   \]
4. Simplify the equation to find \( S \):
   \[
   2S + 30 = 110 \implies 2S = 80 \implies S = 40
   \]
5. Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
   \[
   S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70
   \]

Thus, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(70\).",70,0,

- Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
- Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

2. Subtract the cost of watering and feeding the tree to find the net annual revenue.
3. Determine how many years it will take for the net annual revenue to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue:
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- The tree grows 7 lemons per year.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's subtract the cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3 per year.
- Therefore, the net annual revenue is \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net annual revenue to cover the initial cost:
- The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The net annual revenue is $7.5.
- Therefore, it will take \(\frac{90}{7.5} = 12\) years to start earning money on the lemon",13,0,

3. Subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants.

First, let's find the total number of potted plants Mary initially has:

1. **Calculate the total volume of tomatoes needed before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - The volume of the tomatoes is halved when cooked.
   - Therefore, the total volume of tomatoes needed before cooking is:
     \[
     32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine how many 16-ounce cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - To find the number of cans needed, we divide the total volume by the volume each can contains:
     \[
     \frac{64}{16} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
     \[
     4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ tomatoes}

1. **First Month:**
   The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the first month's downloads.
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads.
   - Calculate 30% of 180:
   \[
   0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   - Subtract this from the second month's downloads:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126

4. **Total Downloads:**
   Sum the downloads from all three months:

2. Since she can skip at half the rate of her running speed, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.
3. Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, so her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.
4. Dana spends one-third of the time running, so she runs for \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
5. Dana spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she walks for \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

63,643,ar,"First, let's determine the charges for the first half of the year. Since there are 12 months in a year, half of that is 6 months. The streaming service charges $140 per month for these 6 months.

\[
140 \times 6 = 840
\]

Now, let's calculate the charges for the second half of the year. The streaming service charges 10% less than the initial monthly rate for the second half of the year.

\[
140 - (0.1 \times 140) = 140 - 14 = 126
\]

So, the streaming service charges $126 per month for the second 6 months.

\[
126 \times 6 = 756
\]

To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we add the amounts from the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

First, we calculate her salary after the first year:

Next, we calculate her salary after the second year:

Finally, we calculate her salary after the third year:
\[
\text{New monthly salary} = 726 + 0.10 \times 726 = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6

To find her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had at the beginning.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work from the total number of Post-it notes she had.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had remaining overall from the result of step 2.

Step 1: Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
Step 2: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes. After using these, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had at the beginning is the sum of the Post-it notes she used and the Post-it notes she has remaining, which is \(220 + 23 = 243\).
Step 3: The number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is \(243 - 80 = 163\).

First, let's determine the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:
\[ \text{Time for first 40%} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

After the restart, the remaining 60% of the file needs to be downloaded:
\[ \text{Time for remaining 60%} = \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Add the time required for the restart:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtract the time for the restart:
\[ \text{Total time} = 100 \text{ minutes} - 20 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

First, calculate the charge for the first half of the year:
- The initial monthly charge is $140.
- There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
- Total charge for the first half of the year = $140 \times 6 = $840.

Next, calculate the charge for the second half of the year:
- The monthly charge is reduced by 10% for the second half.
- The reduced monthly charge is $140 \times 0.90 = $126.
- There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
- Total charge for the second half of the year = $126 \times 6 = $756.

Finally, add the total charges from both halves to find the total amount paid for the year:
- Total amount paid = $840 + $756 = $1596.

1. **Points in the first 20 minutes:**
   Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

2. **Points in the second 20 minutes:**
   Mike scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we calculate:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, he scores 1 more point in the second 20 minutes. Thus, the total points in the second 20 minutes are:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Total points:**
   Adding the points from both intervals, the total points scored by Mike is:

27,675,ar,"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. She buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton.

First, let's determine how many servings of ice cream Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
\[
1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

Next, we need to figure out how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Since each carton contains 15 servings, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of these 4 cartons. Each carton costs $4.00:
\[
4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{ carton} = \$16.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream is:

\[
\text{Gerald's original time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much time Gerald has improved due to his diet. Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To calculate the improvement, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Improvement} = 0.10 \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 4 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we add this improvement to Gerald's original time:

\[
\text{Gerald's improved time} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in \boxed{36",36,0,

65,683,ar,"To determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Jim spends watching TV and reading each day.
2. Determine the time Jim spends watching TV and reading each week.
3. Calculate the total time Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

First, let's calculate the time Jim spends watching TV and reading each day:
- Jim watches TV for 2 hours each day.
- Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour each day.
- Therefore, each day he spends \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours on TV and reading.

Next, let's calculate the time Jim spends watching TV and reading each week:
- Jim does this 3 times a week, so each week he spends \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) hours.

Finally, let's calculate the total time Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks:
- In 4 weeks, he spends \( 9 \times 4 = 36 \) hours.

   \[
   1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the remaining 180 days.
   \[
   2 \text{ cups/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 360 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Now, add the amounts from both periods to get the total amount of dog food consumed in one year.
   \[
   180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. Finally, determine the number of bags needed if each bag contains 110 cups.
   \[
   540 \text{ cups} \div 110 \text{ cups/bag} = 5 \text{ bags}

   - We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**

   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

4. **Sum the number of sheep in all three cities:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Charleston has 80 sheep.
   - Toulouse has 160 sheep.
   - Adding these together, we get:

- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- The cost per dozen is $68.
- Total cost for donuts = \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- The cost per dozen is $80.
- Total cost for mini cupcakes = \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- The cost per dozen is $55.
- Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
- Total cost = \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\) dollars.

Step 1: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \(\frac{x}{3}\).

Step 2: She sold 2 more at the red house, so she had:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]

Step 3: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she had:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 2 \]

Step 4: We know she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales, so:
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 2 = 5 \]

Step 5: Solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 7 \]
\[ x = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is \(21\boxed{} \).",18,0,

1. **Kittens adopted from the shelter:**
   - The sisters adopted 7 kittens from the shelter.

2. **Kittens from Patchy:**
   - Patchy has had three times the number of adopted kittens. Since 7 kittens were adopted, Patchy has had:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ kittens}
   \]

3. **Kittens from Trixie:**
   - Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Next, we add all the kittens together:
- Kittens adopted from the shelter: 7
- Kittens from Patchy: 21
- Kittens from Trixie: 12

The total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has is:
\[
7 + 21 + 12 = 40

98,715,ar,"To determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the original number of cars on the motorway.
2. Subtract the number of cars that took the exit.
3. Subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. The remaining number of cars is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Original number of cars on the motorway: 30
2. Cars that took the exit: 5
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25
   \]
   So, there are 25 cars remaining after taking the exit.
3. Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: 20
   \[
   25 - 20 = 5
   \]
   So, there are 5 cars remaining after the remaining 15 minutes.

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 15.",5,0,

41,723,ar,"1. Initially, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
2. With the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.
3. Therefore, with the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.
4. The dragon's flames have a reach of 1000 feet.

To find out how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand while holding the gemstone:
- The maximum throw distance with the gemstone is 1200 feet.
- The reach of the dragon's flames is 1000 feet.

Thus, the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames she can stand and still hit the dragon is:
\[
1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

So, if holding the gemstone, Polly could stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

\[ 0.4 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

This means she still needs to download:

\[ 200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB} \]

Carla's download speed is 2 GB per minute, so the time it takes to download 120 GB is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the time it takes to download the remaining 120 GB to the time it took to restart:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is:

10,739,ar,"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we will calculate the number of downloads for each month step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \(3 \times 60 = 180\).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the third month reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   - To find the reduced number, calculate \(180 \times 0.30 = 54\).
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is \(180 - 54 = 126\).

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - Add the number of downloads from each month: \(60 + 180 + 126 = 366\).

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is \(366\).",366,0,

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
2. Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire eats in one week. She makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 84 by 12:
\[ \frac{84}{12} = 7 \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.",7,0,

1. The initial bill is $40.00.
2. The delivery fee is 25% of $40.00.
3. The delivery fee is $3.00.
4. The tip is $4.00.

Let's calculate each step:

1. The delivery fee is:
   \[
   0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
   \]

2. Adding the delivery fee:
   \[
   10.00 + 3.00 = 13.00
   \]

3. Adding the tip:
   \[
   13.00 + 4.00 = 17.00

\[
\text{Total for first half} = 140 \times 6 = 840
\]

Next, let's calculate the amount charged per month for the second half of the year. Since the streaming service charges her 10% less for the second half:

\[
\text{Amount per month for second half} = 140 - (0.10 \times 140) = 140 - 14 = 126
\]

Now, calculate the total for the second half of the year, which consists of six months:

\[
\text{Total for second half} = 126 \times 6 = 756
\]

Finally, we sum the amounts paid in both halves to get the total paid for the entire year:

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 840 + 756 = 1596

4,763,ar,"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed given per chicken and then apply it to the entire flock.

1. **Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - Morning: 15 cups
   - Afternoon: 25 cups
   - Total: \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups

2. **Calculate the total amount of feed needed per chicken for the day:**
   - Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Total: \( 3 \) cups per chicken

3. **Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock:**
   - There are 20 chickens.
   - Total: \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) cups

4. **Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   - Total feed needed: 60 cups
   - Feed given in morning and afternoon: 40 cups
   - Total: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

1. **Packages of 3 flowers:**
   - Cost per package of 3 flowers: $2.50
   - Number of packages needed for 18 flowers: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - Total cost for packages of 3 flowers: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \)

2. **Packages of 2 flowers:**
   - Cost per package of 2 flowers: $1
   - Number of packages needed for 18 flowers: \( \frac{18}{2} = 19 \)
   - Total cost for packages of 2 flowers: \( 19 \times 1 = 19 \)

Now, let's compare the two costs:
- Total cost for packages of 3 flowers: $15
- Total cost for packages of 2 flowers: $19

Vincent saves $4 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 instead of packages of 2.

2. 5 packs of milk at $3 each: \(5 \times 3 = 15\)
3. 4 apples at $1.50 each: \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\)

Adding these costs together gives:

\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \]

So, the total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $33.

Next, we know that Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the pizza is:

\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:

\[ \frac{17}{8.50} \]

Performing the division:

\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Thus, Marie ordered two boxes of pizza.",2,0,

1. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half her running speed.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.
   - Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance traveled in six hours:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.
   - Distance traveled running: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.

45,803,ar,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

1. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 * (2/5) = 2 additional articles than on Monday. Therefore, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, we can calculate the total hours spent each day:

- Monday: 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours
- Tuesday: 7 articles * 4 hours/article = 28 hours
- Wednesday: 14 articles * 4 hours/article = 56 hours

Now, we sum up the total hours spent over the three days:

20 hours + 28 hours + 56 hours = 104 hours

50,803,ar,"First, we need to determine how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a week. Since the chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can calculate the weekly production as follows:

\[
252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}
\]

Next, we need to convert the weekly production of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total weekly production by 12:

\[
1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozens/week}
\]

Now, Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. Therefore, we can calculate his weekly revenue by multiplying the number of dozens sold by the price per dozen:

\[
147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week}
\]

Thus, the final numeric result is:

\[
\boxed{294 \text{ dollars/week}}

72,803,ar,"To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.

\[ \text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.

\[ \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = 92 \]

Now, we sum the revenues from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from brownies} + \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 129 + 92 = 221 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Tommy raises is \(221\).",221,0,

35,827,ar,"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

First, we know that Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the points scored in the second 20 minutes. Since he scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes, we need to find 25% of 4 and add it to 4.

\[
25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
\]

Adding this to the original 4 points gives us:

\[
4 + 1 = 5
\]

Therefore, Mike scores 5 points in the second 20 minutes.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to find the total points:

\[
4 + 5 = 9
\]

Thus, Mike scored a total of 

9 points.",9,0,

2. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
3. She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants on the window ledges:
\[ 2 \text{ plants per ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has before giving any away:
\[ 18 \text{ new plants} + 80 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Now, let's calculate how many plants Mary will give away:
\[ 1 \text{ plant per ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, let's determine how many plants Mary will remain with:
\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.

So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330

So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

84,835,ar,"Let \( L \) represent the number of games lost and \( W \) represent the number of games won. According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. The total number of games played is 22:
   \[
   L + W = 22
   \]

2. The number of games won is 8 more than the number of games lost:
   \[
   W = L + 8
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[
L + (L + 8) = 22
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2L + 8 = 22
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
2L = 14
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
L = 7
\]

Now, substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the second equation to find \( W \):

\[
W = 7 + 8 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of games won is \( \boxed{15 \).",15,0,

   - The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts: \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \)

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes: \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \)

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes: \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \)

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694

1. **Identify James's age:**
   James is 10 years old.

2. **Determine Corey's age:**
   James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey's age is:
   \[
   \text{Corey's age} = \text{James's age} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]

3. **Determine Amy's age:**
   Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, Amy's age is:
   \[
   \text{Amy's age} = \text{Corey's age} - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

4. **Determine Jackson's age:**
   Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson's age is:
   \[
   \text{Jackson's age} = \text{Amy's age} - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4
   \]

Thus, Jackson is 4 years old.

19,851,ar,"First, let's determine the total time Marissa has already walked. She walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour. So, she spent a total of 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

Next, let's determine how many miles Marissa has left to walk. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

We know that the total time Marissa needs to complete the trail should be the sum of the time she has already spent and the time she needs for the remaining distance. Since she has already spent 2 hours, the total time she needs is 2 + 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the speed at which she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles to complete the trail in 3 hours. To do this, we use the formula: speed = distance / time. So, the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance is 6 miles / 3 hours = 2 miles per hour.

Next, calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the remaining days (180 days - 180 days):

Now, add the two amounts together:

1. Determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school.
2. Calculate the total number of students at the school.
3. Determine the number of teachers based on the ratio given.

**Step 1: Determine the number of boys.**

We know that there are twice as many boys as girls. Given that there are 60 girls, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of students.**

The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of teachers.**

We know that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5:
\[
\text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

39,867,ar,"1. We know Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.
2. Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.
3. Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. Let's find how long she spends each activity in six hours.

   - Time spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours
   - Time spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours

4. Now, we calculate the distance she covers each activity:
   - Distance run: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles
   - Distance walked: \(1.5 \times 4 = 6\) miles

5. The total distance she travels in six hours is:
   \[
   12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

45,867,ar,"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average number of hours per article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Number of articles: 5
   - Hours per article: 4
   - Total hours on Monday: \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) hours

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Number of articles: \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \)
   - Hours per article: 4
   - Total hours on Tuesday: \( 7 \times 4 = 28 \) hours

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Number of articles: \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \)
   - Hours per article: 4
   - Total hours on Wednesday: \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) hours

   - John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.
   - Number of blue ties = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \).

2. Next, we determine the cost of each red tie:
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - Cost of each red tie = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \).

3. We calculate the number of red ties:
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

4. Finally, we calculate the total cost of all ties:
   - Total cost = (Number of blue ties * Cost per blue tie) + (Number of red ties * Cost per red tie)
   - Total cost = (5 * 40) + (10 * 60)
   - Total cost = 200 + 600 = 800 \).",800,0,

36,875,ar,"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how much he spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of one yogurt.
2. Calculate the daily cost of yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost over 30 days.

First, we find the cost of one yogurt:
\[
\text{Cost of one yogurt} = \frac{5.00}{4} = 1.25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the daily cost of yogurt:
\[
\text{Daily cost} = 2 \times 1.25 = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total cost over 30 days:
\[
\text{Total cost over 30 days} = 30 \times 2.50 = 75.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 360 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the two amounts to find the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we divide the total amount by the cups per bag to find the number of bags needed:
\[ 540 \text{ cups} \div 110 \text{ cups/bag} = 5 \]

10,899,ar,"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   - First, find 30% of 180:
     \[
     0.30 \times 180 = 54
     \]
   - Subtract this from the number of downloads in the second month:
     \[
     180 - 54 = 126
     \]

4. **Total Downloads:**
   Sum the downloads from all three months:
   \[
   60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

26,907,ar,"Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. We need to calculate the total cost of each type of clothing item and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of pairs of shorts:**
   - One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - 3 pairs of shorts cost: \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\).

2. **Cost of pairs of pants:**
   - One pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - 3 pairs of pants cost: \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\).

3. **Cost of pairs of shoes:**
   - One pair of shoes costs $42.
   - 3 pairs of shoes cost: \(3 \times 42 = 126\).

Now, we sum up the costs for all the clothing items:
\[
49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243

62,907,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the given conditions:

1. If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of her pension per year.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she does not qualify for the higher pension starting after 20 years. Therefore, she will receive the 5% of her pension value per year.

Given that she works for 30 years, let's denote her pension value as \( P \). The problem does not provide the exact value of the pension, but we do know that if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. If she works for 30 years, she will get 5% of her pension value.

Since the exact pension value is not provided, we can only express her annual pension as 5% of her pension value. Therefore, the annual pension she will receive is:

26,923,ar,"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

2. **Cost of pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - One pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - One pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, we sum the costs of all the items:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$boxed{243}.",243,0,

50,923,ar,"To determine how much Lloyd makes selling eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Therefore, in one week (7 days), they produce:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. Therefore, his total revenue per week is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]",294,0,

63,931,ar,"1. Calculate the monthly charge for the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total charge for the first half of the year: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the monthly charge for the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is 10% less than $140.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - So, the monthly charge for the second half of the year is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total charge for the second half of the year: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year.
   - Total amount paid = Charge for the first half of the year + Charge for the second half of the year
   - Total amount paid = $840 + $756 = $1596

62,939,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of work, we need to consider her initial pension and the additional 5% of her pension per year starting from the 20th year.

First, let's calculate her initial pension:
\[ \text{Initial pension} = \$50,000 \]

Next, we calculate the additional 5% of her pension per year starting from the 20th year. Since she quits after 30 years, she is eligible for the additional 5% of her pension for 10 years (from the 20th year to the 30th year):
\[ \text{Additional 5% of pension} = 0.05 \times \$50,000 = \$2,500 \]

Now, we add the additional 5% of her pension to her initial pension:
\[ \text{Total pension} = \$50,000 + \$2,500 = \$52,500 \]

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is:

98,939,ar,"To determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to account for the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

1. **Initial number of cars on the motorway:**
   There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that took the exit:**
   5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam. So, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:**
   20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. To find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through:
   \[
   25 - 20 = 5

61,947,ar,"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to break down the costs into their respective categories and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the material**: $500
2. **Cost for the jeweler**: $800
3. **Insurance cost**: 10% of the total cost of the material and the jeweler

First, let's calculate the total cost of the material and the jeweler:
\[
\text{Total cost of material and jeweler} = 500 + 800 = 1300
\]

Next, we calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost:
\[
\text{Insurance cost} = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130
\]

Finally, we sum up all the costs to find the total amount Janet paid:
\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 500 + 800 + 130 = 1430
\]

Thus, the total amount Janet paid for the brooch is:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the number of eggs from dozens to dozens.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs produced per week. Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the number of eggs produced per week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we convert the number of eggs from dozens to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Finally, we calculate the revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times \$2 \text{ per dozen} = \$294 \]

1. Determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school.
2. Calculate the total number of students at the school.
3. Determine the number of teachers based on the given ratio.

**Step 1: Determine the number of boys.**

We know that there are twice as many boys as girls. Given that there are 60 girls, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of students.**

The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of teachers.**

We know that there are 5 students for every teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers is:
\[
\text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

After the first 180 days, there are 365 - 180 = 185 days left in the year.

Cecilia has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the remaining 185 days. Therefore, she will need 185 * 2 = 370 cups for these 185 days.

To find the total amount of dog food needed for the entire year, we add the amount needed for the first 180 days to the amount needed for the remaining 185 days:

180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to divide the total amount of dog food needed by the number of cups in one bag to find the number of bags required:

550 cups / 110 cups per bag = 5 bags.

1. **Material Cost**: $500
2. **Jeweler's Construction Cost**: $800
3. **Insurance Cost**: This is 10% of the total cost before insurance.

First, let's calculate the total cost before insurance:
\[ \text{Total Cost Before Insurance} = \text{Material Cost} + \text{Jeweler's Construction Cost} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost Before Insurance} = 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we calculate the insurance cost:
\[ \text{Insurance Cost} = \text{Total Cost Before Insurance} \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Insurance Cost} = 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we sum up all the costs to find the total amount paid:

   - Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
   - To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 6 packages.
   - Total cost = 6 packages * $2.50/package = $15

2. Next, calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.
   - Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
   - To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 9 packages.
   - Total cost = 9 packages * $1/package = $9

3. Determine the cheaper option by comparing the total costs from steps 1 and 2.
   - Total cost for packages of 3: $15
   - Total cost for packages of 2: $9

4. The cheaper option is buying the flowers in packages of 2.

5. Calculate the amount of money saved by choosing the cheaper option.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we know that Tom needs to travel back the same distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time it takes to travel 30 miles at 6 miles per hour is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for Tom to get back is:

1. Calculate the number of boys.
2. Determine the total number of students.
3. Use the ratio of students to teachers to find the number of teachers.

First, we know that there are twice as many boys as girls. Given that there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

We are told that there are 5 students to every teacher. Therefore, to find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the ratio of students to teachers:
\[
\text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36
\]

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is:

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend says:
   \[
   40 + 20 = 60 \text{ jelly beans}

2. Determine the number of potted plants Mary will give away.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants.

First, calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has initially:
- Mary received 18 new potted plants.
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
\[
2 \times 40 = 80

Next, determine the number of potted plants Mary will give away:
- Mary will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges.

\[
\text{Total download time} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to account for the download time before and after the restart. The download from 0% to 40% is:

\[
\text{Download time} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Then, there is a 20-minute pause for the restart. After the restart, she downloads the remaining 80 GB again, which takes another 40 minutes.

\[
\text{Total download time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes}

First, calculate her regular hours earnings:
- Eliza works 40 regular hours at a rate of $10 per hour.
\[
40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400
\]

Next, calculate her overtime hours earnings:
- Eliza works 45 hours in total, so her overtime hours are:
\[
45 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]
- Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is:
\[
10 \times 1.2/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour}
\]
\[
5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60
\]

Finally, add her regular and overtime earnings to find her total weekly earnings:
\[
\$400 + \$60 = \$460

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost of the cartons.

First, let's find the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days:
\[
1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Since each carton contains 15 servings:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the cartons. Each carton costs $4.00:

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and that Lee used to run two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can calculate Gerald's initial time as follows:

\[
\text{Gerald's initial time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}

Next, we need to find out how much Gerald improved his time. Gerald improved his speed by 10%, so we calculate:

\[

\]

Finally, we add this improvement to Gerald's initial time to find his new time:

\[

Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in \boxed{}",36,0,

Step 1: Determine the number of cats.
Since the number of dogs is 60 and there are two cats for every dog, we calculate the number of cats as follows:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of rabbits.
The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
\[ \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180 \]
Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

   - The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip.
   - The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
   - Therefore, the distance from the start to the second stop is \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

2. Calculate the distance from the start of the trip to the first stop:
   - The first stop is after 20 miles.
   - Therefore, the distance from the start to the first stop is 20 miles.

3. Calculate the distance between the first and second stops:
   - The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the distance from the start to the second stop and the distance from the start to the first stop.

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   The combined number of dogs and cats is the sum of the number of dogs and the number of cats:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   60 + 120 + 168 =",348,0,
