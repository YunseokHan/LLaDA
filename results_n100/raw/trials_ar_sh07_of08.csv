94,15,ar,"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know that the number of dogs is 60.
   - There are two cats for every dog.
   - Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - The number of cats is 120.
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
     \[60 + 120 + 168 = 348\].",348,0,

2. For the remaining days (365 days - 180 days = 185 days), the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day.

First, calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 185 days:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, find the total amount of dog food consumed:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:
\[ 550 \div 110 = 5 \]

36,31,ar,"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of 2 yogurts.
2. Determine the total cost for one day.
3. Calculate the total cost for 30 days.

First, let's find the cost of 2 yogurts. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, the cost of 2 yogurts is:
\[
\frac{5}{4} \times 2 = 2.50
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for one day. Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so the cost for one day is:
\[
2 \times 2.50 = 5.00
\]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for 30 days. Since the cost for one day is $5.00, the cost for 30 days is:
\[
5.00 \times 30 = 150.00
\]

Thus, the amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[

68,39,ar,"To determine the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   We know there are twice as many boys as girls. Given there are 60 girls:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls:
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Determine the ratio of students to teachers:**
   We know there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5:
   \[
   \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36
   \]

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is \boxed{}",36,0,

- Each blue tie costs $40.
- John spent $200 on blue ties.
- Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5.

Next, determine the number of red ties John bought.
- John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
- Number of red ties = 2 × Number of blue ties = 2 × 5 = 10.

Next, calculate the cost of each red tie.
- Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
- Blue ties cost $40 each.
- 50% of $40 = 0.5 × $40 = $20.
- Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20 = $60.

Finally, calculate the total amount spent on all ties.
- Total cost = Cost of blue ties + Cost of red ties.
- Total cost = (5 × $40) + (10 × $60) = $200 + $600 = $800.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies**: The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Emeralds**: The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   \[
   \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of each type of gem:
\[

\[
600 \times 0.10 = 60
\]
So, the new monthly salary after each year is:
\[
600 + 60 = 660
\]

Since Sylvie has been with the company for 5 years, her salary has already increased once. Therefore, her monthly salary after the first increase is:
\[
660
\]

Now, calculate her monthly salary after three more years of service. Since the company increases the salary by 10% each year, after three more years, her monthly salary will be:
\[
660 + 60 = 720
\]

Finally, calculate her annual salary after three more years by multiplying her monthly salary by 12:
\[
720 \times 12 = 8640

1. Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and gets an annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of her pension per year.
3. If Marcy quits after 30 years, she has been working for 10 years beyond the initial 20 years.
4. Therefore, the remaining years of service are 10 years.
5. Since the pension calculation is based on the full 40 years, she will receive 5% of her annual pension for the remaining 10 years.

Let's calculate her annual pension based on the remaining years:

- The full annual pension for 40 years is $50,000.
- 5% of $50,000 is \(0.05 \times 50000 = 2500\).

Thus, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be 2500 dollars.",25000,0,

   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Time to walk the first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time to walk the next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time spent walking = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

2. **Calculate the required time to reach an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Total time required for average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

3. **Determine the remaining distance and remaining time:**
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already walked
   - Remaining distance = 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining time = Total time required - Total time spent walking
   - Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
   - Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

41,63,ar,"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the javelin when not holding the gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
3. Determine the difference between the distance with the gemstone and the reach of the dragon's flames.

1. Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone.
2. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone is:
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The reach of the dragon's flames is 1000 feet. The difference between the distance with the gemstone and the reach of the dragon's flames is:

First, let's calculate the revenue from the marigolds:
- The price per pot of marigolds is $2.74, rounded to $3.
- Revenue from 12 pots of marigolds is \(12 \times 3 = 36\).

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the petunias:
- The price per pot of petunias is $1.87, rounded to $2.
- Revenue from 9 pots of petunias is \(9 \times 2 = 18\).

Finally, let's calculate the revenue from the begonias:
- The price per pot of begonias is $2.12, rounded to $2.
- Revenue from 17 pots of begonias is \(17 \times 2 = 34\).

Now, we sum the revenues from all the flowers:

1. **Cindy's Pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's Pets:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = 4 + 2 = 6

3. **Jan's Pets:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Total Number of Pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total pets} = \text{Jan's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Cindy's pets}

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each: \( 6 \times 60 = 360 \)
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each: \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \)
- Revenue for Thursday: \( 360 + 160 = 520 \)

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each: \( 12 \times 40 = 480 \)
- There are no truck tires repaired on Friday, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- Revenue for Friday: \( 480 \)

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- Difference in revenue: \( 520 - 480 = 40 \)

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, which leaves \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \).

We are told that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 5 + 1 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 6 \times 3 \]

51,87,ar,"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back, we need to first calculate the distance he covered during his outbound trip.

Tom sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a 3-hour period. The speed of the ship is 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he traveled is:

\[
\text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Tom to travel back. We know his return speed is 6 miles per hour. Using the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

we can calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours}
\]

Thus, the time it takes for Tom to get back is:

\[
\boxed{5 \, \text{hours}}

   He spent $200 on blue ties at $40 each:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - Given: Number of dogs is 60.
   - There are 2 cats for every dog.
   - Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - Number of dogs = 60
   - Number of cats = 120
   - Combined number of dogs and cats = \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Number of rabbits = \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
   - Total number of pets = \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

1. **Determine the original volume of the tomatoes used:**
   Freda's batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of the tomatoes used was:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of 16-ounce cans used:**
   Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total original volume by the volume of each can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = \boxed{12 \text{ tomatoes}}

1. Calculate the total amount of feed Wendi gives to her chickens in the morning and in the afternoon.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for all 20 chickens in one day.
3. Subtract the amount of feed already given from the total amount of feed needed to find out how much feed is left for the final meal.

First, calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and in the afternoon:

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Then, calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, sum the costs of all the pastries:

2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings based on the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce per week. Since they produce 252 eggs per day, and there are 7 days in a week, we have:

\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to convert these eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ 1764 \div 12 = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Now, Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

1. Determine the number of jelly beans each friend thinks are in the jar.
2. Sum up all the guesses.
3. Divide the total sum by the number of friends to get the average.

**Step 1: Determine the guesses**
- The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
- The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

**Step 2: Sum up the guesses**
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the average**

First, let's identify the number of kittens adopted from the shelter:

Next, we know that Patchy has had three times the number of kittens adopted from the shelter:

Now, we add all these kittens together to find the total number of kittens:
\[

2. When cooked into sauce, the tomatoes lose half their volume.

First, we need to determine the effective volume of tomatoes used in the sauce, considering the loss of half their volume:
  
   The volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, and it represents half of the original volume:

   If the sauce is 32 ounces, then the original volume of tomatoes used is:

   Since each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans are in 64 ounces:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of miles John runs in a week.
3. Determine John's running speed in miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week:
- On the first day, John runs 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs 3 hours, which is half as much as the first day.
- On the third day, he runs 1.5 hours, which is half as much as the first day.

Total hours in a week = 3 + 3 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

Next, we know that John runs 60 miles a week.

To find his running speed in miles per hour, we divide the total distance by the total time:

74,135,ar,"To determine how much Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then sum the amounts.

First, let's calculate the revenue from marigolds:
- Price per pot of marigolds: $2.74
- Number of pots sold: 12
- Revenue from marigolds: $2.74 * 12 = $33.88

Next, let's calculate the revenue from petunias:
- Price per pot of petunias: $1.87
- Number of pots sold: 9
- Revenue from petunias: $1.87 * 9 = $16.83

Finally, let's calculate the revenue from begonias:
- Price per pot of begonias: $2.12
- Number of pots sold: 17
- Revenue from begonias: $2.12 * 17 = $35.04

Now, we sum the revenues:
Total revenue = $33.88 + $16.83 + $35.04 = $85.75",88,0,
75,135,ar,"To determine the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to calculate the square footage of each level. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level has a square footage of 16.

1. Top level: \(16\) square feet
2. Second level: \(\frac{16}{2} = 8\) square feet
3. Third level: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) square feet
4. Fourth level: \(\frac{4}{2} = 2\) square feet

Next, we sum the square footage of all four levels to find the total square footage:

\[
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square feet}
\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[
\frac{30 \text{ square feet}}{4 \text{ levels}} = 7.5 \text{ square feet per level}
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(7.5\) square feet.",60,0,

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   The combined number of dogs and cats is the sum of the number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pets:**

40% of 200 GB is 80 GB.
Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the first 40% is downloaded, 60% of the file remains. 
60% of 200 GB is 120 GB.
Carla continues to download at a rate of 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 120 GB is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.

Now, we need to account for the 20-minute pause due to the download being interrupted by the Windows restart.

So, the total download time is 40 minutes (first 40%) + 60 minutes (remaining 60%) + 20 minutes (pause) = 120 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the entire 200 GB file.

1. **First 20 Years:**
   - Marcy receives a full annual pension of $50,000.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years: \( 20 \times 50000 = 1000000 \).

2. **Remaining 10 Years:**
   - After 20 years, Marcy receives 5% of her full annual pension.
   - Annual pension for the remaining 10 years: \( 50000 \times 0.05 = 25000 \).
   - Total pension for the remaining 10 years: \( 10 \times 25000 = 250000 \).

Therefore, the total pension for 30 years is:

1. **Determine how much laundry David does:**
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Let \( D \) be the amount of laundry David does.
   - Therefore, \( 4D = 400 \).
   - Solving for \( D \), we get:
     \[
     D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine how much laundry Raymond does:**
   - Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Therefore, Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

3. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:**
   - The difference is \( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

63,167,ar,"To solve this problem, we'll calculate the cost for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The initial monthly charge is $140.
   - For the first half of the year, there are 6 months.
   - Total cost for the first half = $140 * 6 = $840.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The monthly charge in the second half is 10% less than the first half.
   - The monthly charge in the second half is $140 - (10% of $140) = $140 - $14 = $126.
   - Total cost for the second half = $126 * 6 = $756.

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Total cost for the year = $840 + $756 = $1596.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is 1596.",1596,0,

83,175,ar,"To determine the total number of thorns, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Determine the total number of thorns based on the number of roses.

First, let's find the total number of roses:
- Dan plants 3 rose bushes.
- Each rose bush has 25 roses.

\[
\text{Total roses} = \text{Number of rose bushes} \times \text{Roses per bush}
\]

\[
\text{Total roses} = 3 \times 25
\]

\[
\text{Total roses} = 75
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of thorns:
- Each rose has 8 thorns.

\[
\text{Total thorns} = \text{Total roses} \times \text{Thorns per rose}
\]

\[
\text{Total thorns} = 75 \times 8
\]

\[
\text{Total thorns} = 600
\]

Thus, the total number of thorns is:

1. Calculate each friend's guess.
2. Sum all the guesses.
3. Divide the sum by the number of friends.

**Step 1: Calculate each friend's guess.**

- The first friend says 80.
- The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess:
  \[
  \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80
  \]
- The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess:
  \[
  80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
  \]

**Step 2: Sum all the guesses.**

\[
80 + 80 + 100 = 260
\]

**Step 3: Divide the sum by the number of friends.**

\[
\frac{260}{3} = 80

\[
\text{Total cost without interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750
\]

Next, we need to calculate the interest for each cell phone. The interest rate is 2% per month.

\[
\text{Interest per cell phone} = 150 \times 0.02 = 3
\]

Since there are five cell phones, the total interest is:

\[
\text{Total interest} = 5 \times 3 = 15
\]

The total amount Shiela will pay is the total cost without interest plus the total interest.

\[
\text{Total amount to be paid} = 750 + 15 = 765
\]

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255
\]

Thus, Shiela will pay:

1. Identify the number of dogs.
2. Determine the number of cats based on the given ratio.
3. Calculate the number of rabbits based on the relationship with the combined number of dogs and cats.
4. Sum the number of all pets: dogs, cats, and rabbits.

First, we know the number of dogs is 60.

Next, we know there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
\[ 60 + 120 = 180 \]
So, the number of rabbits is:
\[ 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Finally, we sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to get the total number of pets:
\[ 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

1. **Identify the number of sheep in each city:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

2. **Calculate the number of sheep in each city:**
   - Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
   - Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

3. **Add the number of sheep from all three cities:**
   - Total number of sheep = 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse)

4. **Perform the addition:**
   - Total number of sheep = 20 + 80 = 100
   - Total number of sheep = 100 + 160 = 260

Therefore, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is \(260\).",260,0,

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   We know that there are twice as many boys as girls. Given that there are 60 girls:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls:
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

3. **Determine the number of teachers:**
   We are given that there are 5 students to every teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers is:
   \[
   \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, calculate the total number of units in the building:
\[
15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units}
\]

Next, determine the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we calculate:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ units} = 90 \text{ units}
\]

Finally, subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:
\[
120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units}

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

5,239,ar,"To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the regular glasses and the cost of the discounted glasses.

First, let's calculate the cost of the regular glasses. Since every second glass is discounted, there will be 8 regular glasses (because 16 divided by 2 is 8). Each regular glass costs $5, so the cost for the regular glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the discounted glasses. Since every second glass is discounted, there will be 8 discounted glasses (because 16 divided by 2 is 8). Each discounted glass costs 60% of $5, so each discounted glass costs:
\[ 0.6 \times 5 = 3 \]
Therefore, the cost for the discounted glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the regular glasses and the discounted glasses to find the total cost:
\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \]

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
\[2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories}\]

Since a serving is 250 calories, calculate the number of servings you can eat with 200 calories.

\[

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water received by the girls is:

Initially, there were 24 liters of water. After 14 liters have been used, the amount of water left is:

39,247,ar,"First, we need to find Dana's running speed. We know she can skip at 3 miles per hour and that this is half of her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find Dana's walking speed. We know she can run at 6 miles per hour and that this is four times her walking speed. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate how long Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running, so she runs for (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she walks for (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours.

Finally, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking. The distance she covers while running is 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles. The distance she covers while walking is 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Therefore, the total distance she covers in six hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.",18,0,

- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.

First, we need to determine how much laundry David does.
Since Sarah does 400 pounds and she does 4 times as much laundry as David:
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much laundry Raymond does.
Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

94,247,ar,"First, let's determine the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we calculate the number of cats as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:

\[ \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:

\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Finally, we find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

\[ \text{Total number of pets} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:

62,255,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we need to consider the steps carefully.

1. **Initial Pension Calculation:**
   - Marcy works for the company for 30 years.
   - For the first 20 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.
   - For the next 10 years (since 30 - 20 = 10 years), she gets 5% of her pension each year.

2. **Annual Pension Calculation:**
   - For the first 20 years, the pension is $50,000.
   - For the next 10 years, she gets 5% of her initial annual pension.

   Let \( P \) be the initial annual pension. Then, the pension for the next 10 years is \( 0.05P \).

   Since the problem does not provide the initial annual pension, we cannot calculate the exact pension for the next 10 years.

Therefore, without the initial annual pension, we cannot determine the exact annual pension.

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine the number of dozens of eggs produced per week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs produced per week. Since Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day, the number of eggs produced in a week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of dozens of eggs produced per week. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the number of dozens produced is:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \]

39,271,ar,"First, let's determine Dana's running speed. Since she skips at 3 miles per hour, and skipping is half her running speed, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour. 

Next, let's determine her walking speed. Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If she spends six hours in total, she spends \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours running and \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours walking.

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) miles.

And the distance she walks in 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) miles.

Adding these distances together gives the total distance she can travel in six hours: \(12 + 6 = 18\) miles.",18,0,

62,271,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of work, we need to consider the conditions given.

1. If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
3. Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she is eligible for the 5% of the pension per year starting from the 31st year.

Let's assume the total pension value after 30 years is \( P \). The annual pension she receives starting from the 31st year is 5% of the total pension value.

To find the annual pension, we need to know the total pension value after 30 years. However, the problem does not provide the total pension value directly. We only know that the annual pension is 5% of the total pension value.

Given the information, we can only conclude that the annual pension is 5% of the total pension value after 30 years.

1. **Cindy's Pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's Pets:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Jan's Pets:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

Now, we sum the number of pets each person has:

\[
\text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   The number of cats is twice the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   The combined number of dogs and cats is:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Find the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Sum up all the pets:**
   The total number of pets is:

1. Calculate the total cost of supplies for making 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the net profit.

First, let's calculate the cost of supplies for making 20 candles. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and each candle requires 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost for 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \times 2 \times 10 = 400 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Finally, we subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the net profit:
\[ 40 - 400 = -360 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates a loss, not a profit. The final answer is:

1. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
2. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as \( D \).

Given:
- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

From the first relationship:
\[ 400 = 4D \]
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} \]
\[ D = 100 \]

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

From the second relationship:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 \]
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = 200 \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

52,295,ar,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removes. Each comic book weighs \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[
\text{Weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to remove 15 pounds in total from the book bag. Subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight to be removed gives us the weight of the toys.

\[
\text{Weight of toys} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound. To find the number of toys needed to remove 7.5 pounds, we divide the total weight of the toys by the weight of one toy.

\[
\text{Number of toys} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove 15\box toys.",15,0,

\[
600 \times 12 = 7200
\]

Next, we calculate her salary increase for the first year. The company increases salaries by 10% of the initial salary each year, so the increase is:
\[
0.10 \times 7200 = 720
\]
Thus, her salary after the first year is:
\[
7200 + 720 = 7920
\]

For the next two years, her salary increases by the same amount each year. Therefore, her salary after the second year is:
\[
7920 + 720 = 8640
\]
And her salary after the third year is:
\[
8640 + 720 = 9360
\]

So, her annual salary after three more years of service is:
\[
9360
\]

First, let's verify the total fuel capacity of her car:

- Sophia used 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again.
- The total fuel capacity used is 4 gallons, which matches the information given.

Next, we need to find out how many miles Sophia traveled with 4 gallons of gas:
- Sophia traveled 100 miles in 4 gallons of gas.
- Therefore, the fuel efficiency is calculated as \( \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \).

Since the car's tank holds 12 gallons, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is:

1. **Identify the number of sheep in each city:**
   - We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
     \[
     \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
     \[
     \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times 80 = 160
     \]

2. **Sum the number of sheep in all three cities:**
   - Total number of sheep = Number of sheep in Toulouse + Number of sheep in Charleston + Number of sheep in Seattle
   \[
   \text{Total number of sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20

1. Calculate her initial annual salary.
2. Determine the annual increase in her salary.
3. Calculate her new annual salary after three more years of service.

**Step 1: Calculate her initial annual salary.**

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. Therefore, her initial annual salary is:
\[ 600 \times 12 = 7200 \]

**Step 2: Determine the annual increase in her salary.**

The company increases her salary by 10% of her initial salary every year. So, the annual increase is:
\[ 0.10 \times 7200 = 720 \]

**Step 3: Calculate her new annual salary after three more years of service.**

After three years of service, her salary will increase by 3 times the annual increase:
\[ 7200 + 3 \times 720 = 7200 + 2160 = 9360 \]

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is 10 liters.
   - The drink is two-thirds water.
   - Water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = 10 \) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters.
   - The drink is three-fifths water.
   - Water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - One liter of the orange drink is spilled.
   - The total amount of water in the remaining drink = Water in the remaining orange drink + Water in the pineapple drink.
   - Total water = \( 9 \) liters + \( 9 \) liters = \( 18 \) liters.

Thus, the final amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 18 liters.",15,0,

First, let's round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 \approx $3
- Petunias: $1.87 \approx $2
- Begonias: $2.12 \approx $2

Next, we calculate the revenue for each type of flower:
- Revenue from marigolds: \(12 \text{ pots} \times \$3 \text{ per pot} = \$36\)
- Revenue from petunias: \(9 \text{ pots} \times \$2 \text{ per pot} = \$18\)
- Revenue from begonias: \(17 \text{ pots} \times \$2 \text{ per pot} = \$34\)

Now, we sum the revenues from all types of flowers to find the total revenue:
\[
\$36 + \$18 + \$34 = \$88

- For the first 20 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.

1. The cost of 3 flowers is $2.50.
2. To get 18 flowers, you would need to buy 6 packages of 3 flowers.
3. Therefore, the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

Next, calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1:

1. The cost of 2 flowers is $1.
2. To get 18 flowers, you would need to buy 9 packages of 2 flowers.
3. Therefore, the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is 9 * $1 = $9.

Now, compare the two costs and find out how much money Vincent saves:

1. Calculate the total distance Marissa has walked so far.
2. Determine the total time she has spent walking so far.
3. Calculate the remaining distance she needs to walk.
4. Determine the time needed to cover the remaining distance.
5. Calculate the required speed to cover the remaining distance in the remaining time.

Step 1: Total distance walked so far = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
Step 2: Total time spent walking so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours
Step 3: Remaining distance to walk = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles
Step 4: Time needed to cover the remaining distance = 12 hours - 12 hours = 0 hours (since the remaining time is 0)

Step 5: Required speed = 6 miles / 0 hours (undefined)

Since the time is 0, the required speed is undefined.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{\text{undefined}}.",6,0,

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:

1. **Calculate the number of players in each school:**
   - Each school has one girls' team and one boys' team.

   - Therefore, the total number of players per school is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

2. **Calculate the number of coaches in each school:**
   - Each school has one coach for each team.
   - Since there are 2 teams (girls' and boys'), the total number of coaches per school is \(1 \times 2 = 2\).

3. **Calculate the total number of people per school:**
   - Total people per school = Number of players + Number of coaches
   - Total people per school = 10 + 2 = 12

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:

- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- Therefore, the cost is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.

1. **First friend's guess:**
   \[
   \text{First friend's guess} = 80
   \]

2. **Second friend's guess:**
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

3. **Third friend's guess:**
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we find the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{\text{First friend's guess} + \text{Second friend's guess} + \text{Third friend's guess}}{3} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

1. **Initial number of cars on the motorway:**
   There are originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that take an exit:**
   5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam. Therefore, the number of cars that actually drive through the traffic jam is:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Cars that drive through in the remaining 15 minutes:**
   20 cars drive through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

4. **Calculate the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes:**
   Subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam:
   \[
   25 - 20 = 5
   \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings as a teacher:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings as a teacher = $20/hour * 35 hours = $700/week.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings as a cheerleading coach:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings as a cheerleading coach = $30/hour * 15 hours = $450/week.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding her earnings as a teacher and her earnings as a cheerleading coach:
- Total weekly earnings = $700 + $450 = $1150/week.

Finally, let's calculate her annual salary by multiplying her total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a year:
- Annual salary = $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500.",57500,0,

1. **Material Cost:**
   - Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch.

2. **Construction Cost:**
   - Janet pays $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Insurance Cost:**
   - Janet pays 10% of the construction cost for insurance.
   - To find 10% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.10:
     \[
     800 \times 0.10 = 80
     \]
   - Therefore, Janet pays $80 for insurance.

Now, we sum up all these costs:

\[
500 \text{ (material)} + 800 \text{ (construction)} + 80 \text{ (insurance)} = 1380

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.**
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday.
\[
\text{Number of articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7

**Step 2: Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.**
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
\[
\text{Number of articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days.**
\[

First, calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:
\[
\text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
\[
\text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \text{ liters} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

However, one liter of orange drink is spilled, which contains no water. Therefore, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is simply the water from the pineapple drink:
\[
\text{Total water} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

1. **First month:**
   - The number of downloads is given as 60.

2. **Second month:**
   - The number of downloads is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180

3. **Third month:**
   - The number of downloads is reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - 0.30 \times 180 = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

Now, we sum the downloads from all three months to find the total number of downloads:
\[
\text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is:

33,399,ar,"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.

We can express these relationships mathematically:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Now, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.",70,0,

2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in four weeks.

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire eats in one week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, there are 7 days in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of eggs she eats in four weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen:

25,423,ar,"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered excluding the pizza.

1. **Cost of the chicken meal**: $12
2. **Cost of 5 packs of milk**: $3 per pack × 5 packs = $15
3. **Cost of 4 apples**: $1.50 per apple × 4 apples = $6

Next, we add these costs together to find the total cost of the items excluding the pizza:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 = 33
\]

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the pizza boxes is:
\[
50 - 33 = 17
\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[
\frac{17}{8.50} = 2
\]

Thus, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final numeric result is:
\[
2
\]

\[
\boxed{}

First, calculate the revenue from marigolds:

- Revenue from marigolds: \( 2.74 \times 12 = 32.88 \)

Next, calculate the revenue from petunias:

- Number of pots sold: 9
- Revenue from petunias: \( 1.87 \times 9 = 16.83 \)

Finally, calculate the revenue from begonias:
- Price per pot of begonias: $2.12
- Number of pots sold: 17
- Revenue from begonias: \( 2.12 \times 17 = 36.04 \)

The total download time is:
\[
\frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 100 \text{ minutes}

Next, we consider the download process. After 40% of the download, a restart is required. We need to calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file at the rate of 2 GB per minute.

The remaining download time is:
\[
\frac{60\% \text{ of } 200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 60 \text{ minutes}

Adding the 20 minutes for the restart, we get:

50,439,ar,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find the total number of eggs produced per week. Since Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day, and there are 7 days in a week, we calculate:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Since Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, we multiply:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$",294,0,

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston is \(4 \times 20 = 80\).

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - We know that Charleston has 80 sheep.
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

3. **Calculate the total number of sheep:**
   - Toulouse has 160 sheep.
   - Charleston has 80 sheep.
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - The total number of sheep is \(160 + 80 + 20 = 260\).

1. **Diamonds**: We know there are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: We know there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Therefore, the number of rubies is:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: We know there are twice the number of emeralds than rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems in the chest:
\[
175 + 140 + 280
\]

Adding these together:
\[
175 + 140 = 315
\]
\[
315 + 280 = 595

45,463,ar,"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.**
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday.
\[
\text{Number of articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.**
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
\[
\text{Number of articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.**
Meredith wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles in total. Each article takes 4 hours to write.
\[
\text{Total hours spent writing} = 26 \times 4 = 104",104,0,

1. Calculate the 25% delivery fee.
2. Add the delivery fee to the original total.
3. Add the delivery fee.
4. Add the tip.

Let's start with the first step:
\[
\text{Delivery fee} = 25\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
\]

Next, we add this delivery fee to the original total:
\[
40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00
\]

Then, we add the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[
50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:
\[
53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00

\[
\text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lees' time} + 2 = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much Gerald's speed improved due to his diet. Since Gerald's speed improved by 10%, we calculate the improvement in time as follows:

\[
\text{Improvement} = 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we subtract this improvement from Gerald's original time to find his new time:

Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. Since her regular hourly rate is $10, her overtime pay is:
\[
10 \times 1.2 = 12
\]

Eliza worked a total of 45 hours this week. After working the first 40 hours, she worked:
\[
45 - 40 = 5 \text{ hours of overtime}
\]

Eliza earns $12 per hour for overtime. Therefore, her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime are:

To find her total earnings for the week, we add her earnings from the first 40 hours and her earnings from the overtime hours:

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number in the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - To find the number of downloads in the third month, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180.
   - \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \).
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).

\[
\text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = 6 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
\[
\text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of orange drink, the remaining volume of orange drink is:
\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The total volume of the remaining mixture is:
\[
9 \text{ liters (orange drink)} + 15 \text{ liters (pineapple drink)} = 24 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we sum the water in the remaining orange drink and pineapple drink:
\[
6 \text{ liters (orange drink)} + 9 \text{ liters (pineapple drink)} = 15 \text{ liters}

1. Calculate the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday.
3. Sum the total number of articles written over the three days.
4. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing.

Step 1:
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

Step 2:
On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than Monday.
\[ \text{Tuesday articles} = 5 \times 0.4 = 2 \]

Step 3:
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
\[ \text{Wednesday articles} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Step 4:
Total number of articles written over three days = \( 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 \)

Each article takes 4 hours to write.

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.**

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.**

The number of unoccupied units is:

1. Calculate the distance Tom sails from 1 PM to 4 PM.
2. Determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back at a rate of 6 mph.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom sails from 1 PM to 4 PM. He sails for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Tom to travel back at a rate of 6 mph. We use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}

1. Calculate her initial annual salary.
2. Determine the increase in salary each year.
3. Apply the increase for the next three years.

First, let's calculate her initial annual salary. Since she has been with the company for 5 years and the company pays her $600 per month, her initial annual salary is:
\[ 600 \times 12 = 7200 \]

Next, we determine the increase in her salary each year. The company increases her salary by 10% of her initial salary every year. Therefore, the increase each year is:
\[ 0.10 \times 7200 = 720 \]

After three more years of service, her total increase in salary will be:
\[ 720 \times 3 = 2160 \]

Adding this increase to her initial salary gives us her final salary:
\[ 7200 + 2160 = 9360 \]

1. Calculate Raymond's current age.
2. Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born based on the information given.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:

\[ \text{Raymond's current age} = \text{Samantha's current age} - 6 = 31 - 6 = 25 \]

Next, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, the son's current age is:

\[ \text{Son's current age} = \text{Raymond's age at son's birth} + 25 - 23 = 23 + 25 - 23 = 25 \]

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per day.**
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

**Step 3: Calculate the daily revenue from selling the eggs.**
Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. Therefore, the revenue per day is:

55,511,ar,"To determine how many bags Jean can fill, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of lollipops Jean has.
2. Subtract the number of lollipops Jean eats.
3. Divide the remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag to find out how many bags Jean can fill.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. Jean starts with 30 lollipops.
2. Jean eats 2 lollipops, so we subtract 2 from 30:
   \[
   30 - 2 = 28
   \]
   After eating 2 lollipops, Jean has 28 lollipops left.
3. Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the number of lollipops left by the number of lollipops per bag:
   \[
   \frac{28}{2} = 14
   \]
   So, Jean can fill 14 bags.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

34,519,ar,"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine the number of jewels Aaron has:**
   - We know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
   - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - First, calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
     \[
     \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - Then, add 5 to this result to find the number of jewels Aaron has:
     \[
     20 + 5 = 25
     \]
   - Therefore, Aaron has 25 jewels.

2. **Determine the number of jewels Siobhan has:**
   - We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Aaron has 25 jewels, so we subtract 2 from Aaron's total to find Siobhan's jewels:
     \[
     25 - 2 = 23
     \]
   - Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

30,527,ar,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Allen's age 10 years from now given the ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages and their total current age.

1. Let Darrell's age be represented by \(7x\) and Allen's age by \(11x\), based on the given ratio 7:11.
2. According to the problem, the total age of Darrell and Allen is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162 \implies 18x = 162 \implies x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]
3. Now, we calculate Allen's current age:
   \[
   11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]
4. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109
   \]

Therefore, the final numeric result is:

61,535,ar,"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to break down the expenses and sum them up step by step.

1. **Cost of the material:**
   \[
   \$500
   \]

2. **Cost for the jeweler to construct it:**
   \[
   \$800
   \]

3. **Insurance cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost for insurance. First, we calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:
   \[
   \$500 + \$800 = \$1300
   \]
   The insurance cost is 10% of \$1300:
   \[
   0.10 \times \$1300 = \$130
   \]

4. **Total cost:**
   Add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance:
   \[
   \$1300 + \$130 = \$1430
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid for the brooch is:
\[
\boxed{1430
\]",1430,0,

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3}
   \]

2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 2

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house:
   \[

4. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left:

5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{x}{6} = 5 + 1 \implies \frac{x}{6} = 6 \implies x = 36

1. Calculate the total weight that the truck can carry:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Bridge's weight limit} - \text{Weight of the driver and the empty truck}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}

2. Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we divide the total weight that the truck can carry by the weight of one box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} = 83

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is \(83\).",83,0,

\[
\text{Initial cost} = \$80,000
\]

\[
\text{Increase} = 150\% \text{ of } \$80,000 = 1.5 \times \$80,000 = \$120,000
\]

\[
\text{New value} = \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000
\]

Next, subtract the total cost (initial cost + repairs) from the new value to find the profit.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = \$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000

1. **Shorts:**
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Total cost for shorts = \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

2. **Pants:**
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Total cost for pants = \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

3. **Shoes:**
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Total cost for shoes = \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the clothing items:

1. Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
2. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than without the gemstone.

So, we calculate the additional distance:
\[ 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Adding the additional distance to the original throw distance:
\[ 400 + 1200 = 1600 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach within 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand, we subtract the reach of the dragon's flames from the total distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
\[ 1600 - 1000 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

   - Let \( T \) be the number of teachers.
   - Total number of students = 5 × Number of teachers
   - Therefore, \( 5T = 180 \)
   - Solving for \( T \):

1. Calculate the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday.
3. Calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days.
4. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing.

First, let's calculate the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles.

Next, let's calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote over the three days. This is \(5 + 7 + 14 = 26\) articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing is \(4 \times 26 = 104\).",104,0,

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3.**
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To buy 18 flowers, he would need \(\left\lfloor \frac{18}{3} \right\rfloor = 6\) packages.
- Total cost = \(6 \times 2.50\) = $15

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.**
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To buy 18 flowers, he would need \(\left\lfloor \frac{18}{2} \right\rfloor = 9\) packages.
- Total cost = \(9 \times 1\) = $9

1. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
2. The bridge can carry a maximum of 5000 pounds.
3. Each box weighs 15 pounds.

First, we calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck:

\[
5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the remaining weight capacity. We do this by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

\[
\frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} = 83 \text{ boxes}

68,591,ar,"To determine the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of boys:**
   - We know there are twice as many boys as girls.
   - There are 60 girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Determine the total number of students:**
   - The total number of students is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys.
   - Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
   - Total number of students = 60 + 120 = 180

3. **Calculate the number of teachers:**
   - We know there are 5 students for every teacher.
   - The number of teachers is the total number of students divided by the number of students per teacher.
   - Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
   - Number of teachers = 180 / 5 = 36

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36.",36,0,

62,599,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the changes in her pension benefits as she progresses through the years of her employment.

1. **Initial Pension**: Marcy's initial annual pension is $50,000.

2. **Pension After 20 Years**: After 20 years, her pension is still $50,000.

3. **Pension After 30 Years**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of her pension per year. Therefore, her pension after 30 years will be:
   \[
   50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500
   \]

4. **Total Pension After 30 Years**: Adding the additional pension to her initial pension gives her total pension after 30 years:
   \[
   50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500
   \]

Thus, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $52,500.",25000,0,

25,607,ar,"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered other than the pizza boxes.

1. **Cost of the chicken meal:**
   \[
   \$12
   \]

2. **5 packs of milk at $3 each:**
   \[
   5 \times 3 = \$15
   \]

3. **4 apples at $1.50 each:**
   \[
   4 \times 1.50 = \$6
   \]

Now, let's add the costs of these items:

\[
\$12 + \$15 + \$6 = \$33
\]

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the pizza boxes is:

\[
\$50 - \$33 = \$17
\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find the number of boxes ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box:

\[
\frac{\$17}{8.50} = 2
\]

64,615,ar,"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of gas Sophia has used since she last filled her tank.
2. Determine the total miles she has traveled using that gas.
3. Calculate the miles per gallon.
4. Use the miles per gallon to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank.

First, we know Sophia has used 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank again.

Next, we know she traveled 100 miles using that gas.

To find the miles per gallon, we divide the total miles traveled by the total gallons used:
\[
\frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
\]

Now, we know her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Using the miles per gallon:
\[
25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.",300,0,

1. Calculate Sylvie's initial annual salary.
2. Determine the increase in salary for each additional year of service.
3. Calculate the total increase in salary over three years.
4. Add the total increase to her initial salary to find her new salary.

1. Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. Therefore, her initial annual salary is \(600 \times 12 = 7200\) dollars.
2. The increase in salary for each additional year of service is 10% of her initial salary. So, the increase per year is \(0.10 \times 7200 = 720\) dollars.
3. Over three years, the total increase in salary is \(3 \times 720 = 2160\) dollars.
4. Adding the total increase to her initial salary gives \(7200 + 2160 = 9360\) dollars.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \). Therefore, the second friend says \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \). Therefore, the third friend says \( 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now, we find the average of these guesses:

Next, we subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop. Henry's first stop was 20 miles into the trip, and the second stop was 45 miles into the trip. Therefore, the distance between his first and second stops is:

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:

   - Each serving contains 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a bag of chips.
   - Total calories per bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories/bag.

2. Determine the remaining daily calorie target:
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calorie target = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. Calculate the number of servings you can consume without exceeding the remaining calorie target:
   - Remaining calories target = 200 calories.
   - Each serving contains 250 calories.
   - Number of servings allowed = 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 8 servings.

4. Calculate the total weight of the chips you can eat:
   - Each serving is 5 grams.
   - Total weight = 8 servings * 5g/serving = 40g.

47,639,ar,"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, the number of blue ties is:

\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
40 \times 1.5 = 60
\]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the red ties:

\[
10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, the total cost for all the ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[
200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[

37,655,ar,"John starts with 13 lego sets and sells them for $15 each. We calculate the total amount of money he has after selling the lego sets:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, John buys 8 video games at $20 each. We find out how much he spends on the video games:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. We calculate the total amount of money he had initially:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since John initially had $165 and spent $160 on video games, we check if the initial calculation is correct. The amount of money left from selling the lego sets should be:

\[ 165 - 160 = 5 \]

This confirms that John has $5 left after buying the video games. The problem does not specify the number of lego sets he still has, so we conclude that the number of lego sets he still has is:

First, let's calculate the revenue from the marigolds:
- Price per pot: $2.74
- Number of pots: 12
- Revenue from marigolds: \( 2.74 \times 12 = 32.88 \)

39,663,ar,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds first. We know she can skip at 3 miles per hour. Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour. Since she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Next, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If she spends one-third of the time running, she runs for \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours. If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, she walks for \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is the sum of the distance she runs and the distance she walks. The distance she runs is \(6 \times 2\) miles, which is 12 miles. The distance she walks is \(1.5 \times 4\) miles, which is 6 miles",18,0,

17,671,ar,"To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her weekly earnings from both teaching and cheerleading, and then find the total for the year.

1. Calculate weekly earnings from teaching:
   -Jill earns $20 per hour.
   -She works 35 hours a week.
   -Weekly earnings from teaching = $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week.

2. Calculate weekly earnings from cheerleading:
   -Jill earns $30 per hour.
   -She works 15 hours a week.
   -Weekly earnings from cheerleading = $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week.

3. Calculate total weekly earnings:
   -Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings from teaching + Weekly earnings from cheerleading
   -Total weekly earnings = $700/week + $450/week = $1150/week.

4. Calculate annual earnings:
   -Annual earnings = Total weekly earnings * 50 weeks/year
   -Annual earnings = $1150/week * 50 weeks/year
   -Annual earnings = $57,500",57500,0,

52,679,ar,"Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. He is removing 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound. Let's calculate the total weight of the comic books:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much weight is left to be removed after accounting for the comic books. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight to be removed:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:

\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The number of toys he needs to remove is:

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry:
- The current value of the jewelry is $5,000.
- The market will rise by 2.5%.
- The future value of the jewelry is:
  \[
  5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
  \]

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:
- The current value of the electronic gadgets is $8,000.
- The market will rise by 1.2%.
- The future value of the electronic gadgets is:
  \[
  8000 \times 0.112 = 896
  \]

Now, we compare the future values of the jewelry and the electronic gadgets:
- The future value of the jewelry is $5,125.
- The future value of the electronic gadgets is $896.

The jewelry will yield a higher future value and thus a higher profit.",125,0,

39,687,ar,"To solve this problem, we start by determining Dana's running speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour and that her skipping speed is half her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

Next, we determine her walking speed. We know that her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Now, we calculate the distance Dana can travel in six hours. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we first find the time spent running and walking.

- Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours
- Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours

The distance traveled running is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles, and the distance traveled walking is \(1.5 \times 4 = 6\) miles.

Thus, the total distance traveled is \(12 + 6 = 18\) miles.",18,0,

93,695,ar,"1. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. So, Gerald’s original time was 
   \[
   \text{Original time for Gerald} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. Gerald changed his diet, and his speed improved by 10%. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ seconds} = 0.1 \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 4 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New time for Gerald} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.",36,0,

Given that their total age is 162, we can write the equation:
\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]
\[ 18x = 162 \]
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:
- Darrell's current age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's current age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

Next, we need to calculate Allen's age 10 years from now:
\[ \text{Allen's age 10 years from now} = 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's find the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units:
\[
15 \times 8 = 120
\]
So, there are 120 units in total.

Next, we calculate the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4:
\[
120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90
\]
So, there are 90 occupied units.

Finally, we find the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[
120 - 90 = 30
\]
So, the total number of unoccupied units is \boxed{}",30,0,

1. The initial number of cars on the motorway is 30.
2. 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam, so the number of cars that will drive through is:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25

3. 20 cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes, so the total number of cars that drive through is:
   \[
   25 + 20 = 45

4. The number of cars that drive through in the first 15 minutes is the difference between the number of cars that will drive through and the number of cars that drive through in the remaining 15 minutes:

First, calculate the cost of the shorts:

- Total cost for shorts = \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\).

Next, calculate the cost of the pants:

- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Total cost for pants = \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\).

Finally, calculate the cost of the shoes:
- One pair of shoes costs $42.
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Total cost for shoes = \(3 \times 42 = 126\).

51,719,ar,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels during his outbound journey and then calculate the time it takes for him to return to the same distance at a different speed.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom travels during his outbound journey. He sails from 1 PM to 4 PM at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The distance can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to return to this distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the time it takes for Tom to get back is 5 hours. The final answer, wrapped as required, is:
\[
\boxed{5

First, let's calculate the cost for buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, we need \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) packages.
- The cost is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, we need \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) packages.
- The cost is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Comparing the two costs:
- The cost in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost in packages of 2 is $9.

The savings from buying in packages of 2 is:
- \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars.

1. **Cindy's Pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's Pets:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = 4 + 2 = 6

3. **Jan's Pets:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Total Number of Pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets}

   \[

\[

Next, we find the number of girls in the class. The total number of students is 200, so the number of girls is:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

Now, we calculate how many girls are in the Girl Scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout, we have:

\[
\text{Number of girls in the Girl Scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Finally, we find the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout. Since the total number of girls is 120 and 80 are in the Girl Scout, the number of girls not in the Girl Scout is:

\[

2. **Second 20 Minutes:**
   Mike scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 and add it to the original 4 points.

1. **Determine Samantha's current age:**
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.

2. **Determine Raymond's current age:**
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, Raymond's current age is:
     \[
     31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine the year Raymond's son was born:**
   - Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
   - Therefore, Raymond's son was born in the year:
     \[
     25 - 23 = 2023
     \]

4. **Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born:**
   - The current year is 2023.
   - The year Raymond's son was born is 2023.

   Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each,
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. Determine the number of red ties John bought.
   John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties,
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. Calculate the cost of each red tie.
   The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties,
   \[
   \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

4. Calculate the total cost of the red ties.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600

First, we calculate the distance traveled in the first leg:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to travel this distance back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We use the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}}

Performing the division:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{30}{6} = 5 \, \text{hours}

3. Determine the total number of students.
4. Calculate the number of teachers based on the given ratio.

Given:

- There are twice as many boys as girls.

First, calculate the number of boys:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, find the total number of students:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

76,767,ar,"First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in a year.

1. For the first 180 days:
   - The puppy eats 1 cup per day.
   - Total amount consumed in 180 days = 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

2. For the remaining days (365 days - 180 days):
   - The puppy eats 2 cups per day.
   - Total amount consumed in 185 days = 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

Now, let's add the amounts consumed in both periods:
- Total amount consumed in a year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required to cover 550 cups:
- Each bag contains 110 cups.
- Number of bags needed = Total amount consumed / Amount per bag
- Number of bags = 550 cups / 110 cups per bag = 5

Let's calculate the total cost step by step:

1. **Cost of the first 8 glasses:**
   - Each of the first 8 glasses costs $5.
   - Total cost for 8 glasses = \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the next 8 glasses:**
   - Each of the next 8 glasses costs $3.00.
   - Total cost for 8 glasses = \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for all 16 glasses:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the first 8 glasses + Cost of the next 8 glasses
   - Total cost = \( 40 + 24 = 64 \) dollars.

78,791,ar,"To determine the best option for buying 18 flowers, we will compare the cost of buying in packages of 3 and the cost of buying in packages of 2.

First, calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) packages.
- So, the total cost is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) packages.
- So, the total cost is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, compare the costs:
- Buying in packages of 3 costs $15.
- Buying in packages of 2 costs $9.

The better option is buying in packages of 2, which saves \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars.",6,0,

Step 1: Determine Gerald's initial time.
Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he used to be able to run the race two seconds faster than Gerald.
\[ \text{Gerald's initial time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Step 2: Calculate the improvement in Gerald's speed.
Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find the improvement, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds.
\[ \text{Improvement in time} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Step 3: Determine Gerald's new time.
Subtract the improvement in time from Gerald's initial time.
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.",36,0,

Next, we determine how much money John spends on video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each:

8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent on video games is:

\]

The remaining money after selling his lego sets is:
\[
195 - 165 = 30 \text{ dollars}

Since each lego set was sold for $15, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[
\frac{30}{15} = 2 \text{ lego sets}

2. **Pension after 20 years:**
   - After 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of her pension per year.

Let's assume the value of her pension after 30 years is \( P \). Since she is entitled to 5% of this value per year, we can express this as:

\[ 0.05P \]

To find the exact value of her pension after 30 years, we need to know the total value of her pension \( P \). However, the problem does not provide the total value of her pension. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of her annual pension after 30 years without this information.

1. Calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of hours John runs in a day.
3. Calculate John's running speed in miles per hour.

First, let's find out how many hours John runs in a day:
- On the first day, John runs 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as he does on the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.
- Therefore, in a day, he runs \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours.

Next, we know John runs 3 days a week, so the total number of hours he runs in a week is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) hours.

Now, we calculate John's running speed:
- John runs 60 miles in 18 hours, so his speed is \( \frac{60}{18} = 3.33 \) miles per hour.

1. **Calculate the amount of water each girl got:**
   Each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water.
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]
   So, each girl got 4 liters of water.

2. **Calculate the total amount of water given to the two girls:**
   Since there are two girls, we multiply the amount each girl got by 2.
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water given to the two girls and the boy:**
   The boy got 6 liters of water.

4. **Calculate the amount of water left:**
   We subtract the total amount given to the girls and the boy from the original amount.
   \[
   24 - 8 - 6 = 10 \text{ liters}
   \]

Step 1: Determine the number of pets Marcia has.
Cindy has 4 pets, and Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
\[ \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pets Jan has.
Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
\[ \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pets.
Add the number of pets each person has.
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of pets Cindy has} + \text{Number of pets Marcia has} + \text{Number of pets Jan has} \]
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

1. **First Month:**
   The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   First, calculate 30% of the second month's downloads:
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Subtract the reduction from the second month's downloads:
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

Now, sum up the downloads over the three months:
\[
\text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[ 3 \times 68 = 204 \]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[ 6 \times 55 = 330 \]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, we sum these costs:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find the number of eggs produced per week. Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Now, Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

53,847,ar,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and repairs 6 truck tires.
- The mechanic charges $40 for each car tire and repairs 4 car tires.

Total revenue on Thursday:
\[
(6 \times 60) + (4 \times 40) = 360 + 160 = 520
\]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic charges $40 for each car tire and repairs 12 car tires.

Total revenue on Friday:
\[
12 \times 40 = 480
\]

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
\[
520 - 480 = 40
\]

Thus, the mechanic earned $40 more revenue on the day with higher revenue (Thursday) compared to Friday.

The final answer is:
\[

66,855,ar,"To determine the total number of people sent by the four schools, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

1. **Calculate the number of players per school:**
   - Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
   - Each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school has a total of \(5 + 5 = 10\) players.

2. **Calculate the number of coaches per school:**
   - Each school has one coach for each team.
   - There are 2 teams (girls' and boys').
   - Therefore, each school has a total of \(2 \times 1 = 2\) coaches.

3. **Calculate the total number of people per school:**
   - Each school has \(10\) players + \(2\) coaches = \(12\) people.

4. **Calculate the total number of people sent by all four schools:**
   - There are 4 schools.
   - Each school has 12 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people sent is \(4 \times 12 = 48\).

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.

   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**

62,871,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension after working for 30 years, we need to follow the steps and rules provided:

1. **Initial Pension Calculation**:
   - Marcy works for 40 years, so her initial annual pension is $50,000.

2. **Annual Increase Calculation**:
   - Starting after 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - Since she works for 30 years and not 40, the annual increase is calculated for the 10 years after 20 years.
   - The annual increase is 5% of the initial pension: \( 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \) dollars per year.

3. **Final Annual Pension Calculation**:
   - The final annual pension is the initial pension plus the annual increase: \( 50000 + 2500 = 52500 \) dollars per year.

Thus, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be:

66,871,ar,"1. Each school has 2 teams: a girls' and a boys' team.
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also sends 1 coach for each team.

First, calculate the total number of players per school:
- Each team has 5 players.
- There are 2 teams per school.
- Therefore, there are \(5 \times 2 = 10\) players per school.

Next, calculate the total number of coaches per school:
- Each team has 1 coach.
- There are 2 teams per school.
- Therefore, there are \(1 \times 2 = 2\) coaches per school.

Now, sum the players and coaches to find the total number of people sent per school:
- Total people per school = players + coaches
- Total people per school = 10 + 2 = 12

Finally, since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent is:
- Total people sent = Total people per school \(\times\) Number of schools
- Total people sent = 12 \(\times\) 4 = 48

1. Calculate the total weight of the truck combined with the driver.
2. Determine the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.
3. Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded based on the remaining weight capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the truck combined with the driver.**
The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is given as 3755 pounds.

**Step 2: Determine the remaining weight capacity of the bridge.**
The bridge can carry up to 5000 pounds. The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity is:
\[ 5000 - 3755 = 245 \text{ pounds} \]

73,903,ar,"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the five cell phones:**
   Each cell phone costs $150, and Shiela bought five of them.
   \[
   5 \times 150 = 750
   \]

2. **Calculate the interest for each cell phone:**
   The interest rate is 2%, so for each $150, the interest is:
   \[
   150 \times 0.02 = 3
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount including interest:**
   The total amount is the original cost plus the interest.
   \[
   750 + 3 = 753
   \]

4. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   Since the total amount is paid over 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.
   \[
   753 \div 3 = 251

1. Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels.
2. Express the given information in terms of an equation.
3. Solve the equation to find the cost of the boots.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels. One pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much:

\[
33 + 2 \times 33 = 33 + 66 = 99
\]

Next, we know that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots. Let \( B \) be the cost of the boots. According to the problem, the total cost of the high heels is $99, which is $5 less than the cost of the boots:

\[
99 = B - 5
\]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve the equation:

\[
B = 99 + 5 = 104
\]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \(104\).",104,0,

1. **Determine Samantha's current age**:
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.

2. **Determine Raymond's current age**:
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, Raymond is currently \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

3. **Determine Raymond's son's age**:
   - Raymond had a son at the age of 23.

4. **Calculate the number of years Raymond has been having a son**:
   - Raymond is currently 25 years old.
   - Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
   - Therefore, Raymond has been having a son for \(25 - 23 = 2\) years.

5. **Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born**:

1. **Calculate the weekly TV watching time:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours each time.
   - He does this 3 times a week.
   - Total TV watching time = 2 hours/time * 3 times/week = 6 hours/week.

2. **Calculate the weekly reading time:**
   - Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV.
   - He does this 3 times a week.
   - Total reading time = 1 hour/time (half of 2 hours) * 3 times/week = 3 hours/week.

3. **Calculate the total weekly hours spent on TV and reading:**
   - Total weekly hours = 6 hours/week (TV) + 3 hours/week (reading) = 9 hours/week.

4. **Calculate the total hours spent in 4 weeks:**
   - Total hours in 4 weeks = 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs 6 packages.
- Therefore, the total cost is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs 9 packages.
- Therefore, the total cost is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9
  \]

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying in packages of 2 from the cost of buying in packages of 3:
- Savings = $15 - $9 = $6

Thus, Vincent saves $6 by buying the flowers at the better price.

After 5 years, her salary increases by $10\%$ each year. Therefore, her new monthly salary will be $600 + 600 \times 0.1 = 600 + 60 = 660$. 

So, her new annual salary will be $660 \times 12 = 7920$.

For the next three years, her salary will increase again by $10\%$ each year. After the first year, her new monthly salary will be $660 + 660 \times 0.1 = 660 + 66 = 726$. After the second year, her new monthly salary will be $726 + 726 \times 0.1 = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6$.

Thus, her new annual salary after three more years will be $798.6 \times 12 = \boxed{}",9360,0,

26,927,ar,"To determine the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum these costs.

1. Calculate the cost of the shorts:
   \[
   3 \text{ pairs of shorts} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = \$49.50
   \]

2. Calculate the cost of the pants:
   \[
   3 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = \$67.50
   \]

3. Calculate the cost of the shoes:
   \[
   3 \text{ pairs of shoes} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = \$126.00
   \]

4. Sum the costs of all the clothing items:
   \[
   \$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126.00 = \$243.00
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is:

1. Start with the initial number of stickers Charlie had.
2. Add the stickers he bought from the store.
3. Add the stickers he received for his birthday.
4. Subtract the stickers he gave to his sister.
5. Subtract the stickers he used to decorate the greeting card.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. Initial number of stickers: 10
2. Stickers bought from the store: 21 stickers
   \[
   10 + 21 = 31
   \]
3. Stickers for birthday: 23 stickers
   \[
   31 + 23 = 54
   \]
4. Stickers given to sister: 9 stickers
   \[
   54 - 9 = 45
   \]
5. Stickers used to decorate the greeting card: 28 stickers
   \[
   45 - 28 = 17

2. After putting in $50,000 in repairs, the total cost for Josh to buy the house is:
   \[
   80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

3. The value of the house increases by 150% after the repairs. This means the house is now worth:
   \[
   150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000

1. Calculate the total weight of the comic books.
2. Determine the remaining weight to be removed after removing the comic books.
3. Calculate the number of toys needed to remove the remaining weight.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the comic books.**
Each comic book weighs \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound, and Uriah removes 30 comic books.
\[
\text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the remaining weight to be removed after removing the comic books.**
\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 15 - 7 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of toys needed to remove the remaining weight.**
Each toy weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound.
\[
\text{Number of toys} = \frac{8}{\frac{1}{2}} = 8 \times 2 = 16

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each: \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars
- On Thursday, the mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each: \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars
- Total revenue for Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each: \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars
- Total revenue for Friday: \(480\) dollars

Now, we find the difference in revenue between the two days:
- Revenue on Thursday: 520 dollars
- Revenue on Friday: 480 dollars
- Difference: \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars

2. Add the number of Post-it notes she purchased, which we will denote as \( x \).
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used, which is 220.
4. Use the information that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining to set up an equation.

The equation based on the given information is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( x \):

1. Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ -140 + x = 23 \]

2. Solve for \( x \) by adding 140 to both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

First, we substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(70\).",70,0,

57,975,ar,"The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. Each box weighs 15 pounds. Let \( x \) be the number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

First, let's calculate the maximum weight of the boxes the truck can carry:

\[
\text{Maximum weight of boxes} = \text{Total weight limit} - \text{Weight of driver and empty truck}
\]

\[
\text{Maximum weight of boxes} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we determine the maximum number of boxes \( x \) that can be loaded onto the truck:

\[
x = \frac{\text{Maximum weight of boxes}}{\text{Weight of each box}}
\]

\[
x = \frac{1245}{15}
\]

\[
x = 83
\]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is:

1. Identify the number of dogs and cats.
2. Calculate the number of rabbits based on the given relationship.
3. Sum the number of pets of each type to find the total.

First, we know the number of dogs is 60. Since there are two cats for every dog, we calculate the number of cats as follows:
\[
\text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[
\text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[
\text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168
\]

Finally, we sum the number of pets of each type:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
\]

2. He puts in $50,000 in repairs.
3. The repairs increase the value of the house by 150%.

First, calculate the total value of the house after repairs:
\[ \text{Total cost of repairs} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000 \]

Next, calculate the increase in value due to the 150% increase:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = \$130,000 \times 1.50 = \$195,000 \]

Add this increase to the original total cost:
\[ \text{Total value after increase} = \$130,000 + \$195,000 = \$325,000 \]

Finally, calculate the profit:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons Cynthia needs to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the 4 cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, for 4 cartons, the total cost is:

1. **Top Level**: Given as 16 square units.
2. **Second Level**: Half of the top level, so \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square units.
3. **Third Level**: Half of the second level, so \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square units.
4. **Fourth Level**: Half of the third level, so \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square units.

Next, we sum the square footage of all four levels:
\[
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square units}
\]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[
\text{Average Square Footage} = \frac{30 \text{ square units}}{4 \text{ levels}} = 7.5 \text{ square units}
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \( \boxed{7.5 \).",60,0,

Next, we need to calculate the distance he drives after turning around. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time. He then drives for half an hour at a speed of 30 mph:

Finally, he drives for the remaining 1 hour at a speed of 80 mph:

3. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
   \[
   \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet}

4. The dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet.
5. To find out how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and hit the dragon with the javelin, subtract the reach of the dragon from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.
   \[
   \text{Additional distance} = 1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet}

Therefore, if Polly holds the gemstone, she can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the javelin.

1. **Cindy's Pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's Pets:**
   Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6

4. **Total Number of Pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28

1. **Daily Time Spent on TV and Reading:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours each day.
   - He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on TV and reading each day is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours.

2. **Weekly Time Spent on TV and Reading:**
   - Jim does this activity 3 times a week.
   - So, the total time spent on TV and reading each week is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) hours.

3. **Monthly Time Spent on TV and Reading:**
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks is \( 9 \times 4 = 36 \) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 36.",36,0,

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.**
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday.
\[
\text{Number of articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.**
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
\[
\text{Number of articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days.**

76,1015,ar,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food consumed.

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy consumes 1 cup of dog food per day.
2. For the remaining 180 days, the puppy consumes 2 cups of dog food per day.

First, we calculate the total amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days and the remaining 180 days:

- For the first 180 days: 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups
- For the remaining 180 days: 2 cups/day * 180 days = 360 cups

Adding these together gives the total amount of dog food consumed in a year:
180 cups + 360 cups = 540 cups

Since one bag contains 110 cups of dog food, we divide the total amount consumed by the amount per bag to find the number of bags needed:
540 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we calculate the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. To find the number of girls in the Girl Scouts, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the Girl Scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in the Girl Scouts} = 120 - 80 = 40
