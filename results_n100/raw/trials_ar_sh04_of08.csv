1. **Total number of cars on the motorway initially:**
   There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Number of cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam:**
   5 cars took an exit, so they didn't drive through the traffic jam.

3. **Number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:**
   20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

4. **Calculate the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes:**
   - Total cars initially: 30
   - Cars that didn't drive through: 5
   - Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: 20
   - Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes:

First, let's calculate the expected value of the jewelry:
- The initial value of the jewelry is $5,000.
- The expected market rise for jewelry is 2.5%.
- Therefore, the expected value of the jewelry is:
  \[
  5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
  \]

Next, let's calculate the expected value of the electronic gadgets:
- The initial value of the electronic gadgets is $8,000.
- The expected market rise for electronic gadgets is 1.2%.
- Therefore, the expected value of the electronic gadgets is:
  \[
  8000 \times 1.012 = 8096
  \]

Now, we compare the two expected values:
\[
8096 - 5125 = 2971
\]

Since one liter of the orange drink spills, the amount of water in the remaining orange drink is:

   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings.
   - Total calories per bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

2. Calculate the calories you can consume:
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - Remaining calories you can consume = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:
   - You need to consume 200 calories.
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - Number of servings you can eat = 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the comic books removed.**

Uriah removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the remaining weight to be removed.**

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. He has already removed 7.5 pounds from the comic books.

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of toys needed to remove the remaining weight.**

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. We need to find out how many toys are required to remove 7.5 pounds.

\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15

58,28,ar,"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries after the additional fees, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the 25% delivery fee on the final bill.
2. Add the $3.00 in delivery fees.
3. Add the $4.00 tip to the total.

First, let's calculate the 25% delivery fee on the $40.00 final bill:
\[ 25\% \times 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \]

So, the total bill after the 25% fee is:
\[ 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \]

Next, we add the $3.00 in delivery fees:
\[ 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 \]

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total:
\[ 53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00 \]

\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 18x = 162 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 18:

\[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find Allen's current age:

\[ \text{Allen's current age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[ \text{Allen's age in 10 years} = 99 + 10 = 109 \]

38,36,ar,"John runs 60 miles a week and he runs 3 days a week. To find out how many miles he runs per day, we divide the total distance by the number of days:

\[
\frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ miles per day}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many hours John runs each day. On the first day, he runs 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is:

\[
\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours each day}
\]

So, the total time he runs in a day (since he runs for 3 hours on the first day, 1.5 hours on the second day, and 1.5 hours on the third day) is:

\[
3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, to find John's running speed, we divide the distance he runs by the time he runs:

2. Subtract the number of cars that took an exit.
3. Subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. The remaining cars must have driven through in the first 15 minutes.

Let's go through the steps:

1. There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars left is \(30 - 5 = 25\).
3. 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, so we need to subtract these from the remaining cars:
   \[
   25 - 20 = 5

- She walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour.
- She walked the next 2 miles in another 1 hour.

So, she has walked a total of 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

Next, let's determine the total time she has taken to walk these 6 miles.

- She took 1 hour for the first 4 miles.
- She took 1 hour for the next 2 miles.

So, she has taken a total of 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's find out the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 2 hours to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.
The remaining time is 2 hours.

To find the speed, we use the formula: speed = distance / time.

1. Start with the initial number of stickers Charlie had.
2. Add the stickers he bought from the store.
3. Add the stickers he received for his birthday.
4. Subtract the stickers he gave to his sister.
5. Subtract the stickers he used to decorate a greeting card.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. Initial number of stickers Charlie had: 10
2. Stickers he bought from the store: 21
   \[
   10 + 21 = 31
   \]
3. Stickers he received for his birthday: 23
   \[
   31 + 23 = 54
   \]
4. Stickers he gave to his sister: 9
   \[
   54 - 9 = 45
   \]
5. Stickers he used to decorate a greeting card: 28

2,60,ar,"First, we need to determine the total cost Josh incurred. The cost to buy the house is $80,000, and he spent an additional $50,000 on repairs. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[
80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
\]

Next, we calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value by 150%. To find 150% of the original value, we multiply the original value by 1.5:
\[
80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000
\]
Thus, the new value of the house is $120,000.

Now, to find Josh's profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value:
\[
120,000 - 130,000 = -10,000
\]

Since the result is negative, it indicates a loss rather than a profit. Therefore, Josh's profit is:

62,60,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the conditions given in the problem.

First, let's establish the base pension:
- If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.
- Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Since Marcy works for 30 years, which is 10 years before the 40-year mark, she qualifies for the 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Let's denote the total value of the pension as \( V \). The annual pension for the first 10 years is 5% of \( V \).

Given that the annual pension for 40 years is $50,000, we can infer that:
\[ V = \frac{50000}{0.4} = 125000 \]

Thus, the annual pension for the first 10 years is:
\[ 5\% \times 125000 = 6250 \]",25000,0,

1. The top level has a square footage of 16.
2. Each level below it has a square footage that is half of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Top level: \( 16 \) square feet
- Second level: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
- Third level: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
- Fourth level: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Next, we sum the square footage of all four levels:

\[
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square feet}
\]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[
\frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is:

The discount amount is 25% of the original price, which can be expressed as \( 0.25P \). Therefore, the price Kyle paid is the original price minus the discount:
\[
P - 0.25P = 19.50
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
0.75P = 19.50
\]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[
P = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
\]

Performing the division:
\[
P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = \frac{19.50 \times 4}{3} = \frac{78}{3} = 26
\]

Thus, the original price of the book is:

1. **Determine the cost of supplies for 20 candles:**
   - Each candle requires 1/10 of a pound of beeswax.
   - Therefore, 20 candles will require \( 20 \times \frac{1}{10} = 2 \) pounds of beeswax.
   - One pound of beeswax costs $10.00.
   - The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle sells for $2.00.
   - The revenue from 20 candles is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated as revenue minus cost of supplies.
   - Net profit = revenue - cost
   - Net profit = \( 40 - 20 \)
   - Net profit = $20",20,0,

1. **Time spent watching TV each day:**
   Jim watches TV for 2 hours each day.

2. **Time spent reading each day:**
   Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV each day. Therefore, he reads for \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour each day.

3. **Time spent on TV and reading each day:**
   Total time = Time spent watching TV + Time spent reading
   Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

4. **Time spent on TV and reading each week:**
   Total time = Time spent on TV and reading each day × Number of days per week
   Total time = 3 hours/day × 3 days/week = 9 hours/week

5. **Time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks:**

1. Calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets.
2. Determine how much money John spends on video games.
3. Find out how many lego sets John still has after buying the video games.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets:
\[
13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine how much money John spends on video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, and he has $5 left:
\[
8 \times 20 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many lego sets John still has after buying the video games. We know that he bought all his lego sets initially and sold them all to buy the video games. Therefore, he does not have any lego sets left after buying the video games.

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[

First, let's find out how many articles she wrote on Tuesday:
- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \(5 \times \frac{2}{5} = 2\) times more articles than on Monday.
- Therefore, she wrote \(5 + 2 = 7\) articles on Tuesday.

Next, let's find out how many articles she wrote on Wednesday:
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
- Therefore, she wrote \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours spent:
- On Monday: \(5\) articles * \(4\) hours/article = \(20\) hours
- On Tuesday: \(7\) articles * \(4\) hours/article = \(28\) hours
- On Wednesday: \(14\) articles * \(4\) hours/article = \(56\) hours

1. Calculate the total amount of money John has after selling his lego sets.
2. Subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount of money.
3. Use the remaining money to determine how many more lego sets John can buy.

First, calculate the total amount of money John has after selling his lego sets:
\[
13 \times 15 = 195

Next, calculate the total cost of the video games:
\[
8 \times 20 = 160
\]

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so he initially had:
\[
160 + 5 = 165
\]

Since he spent $160 on video games, the amount of money he used to buy more lego sets is:
\[
165 - 160 = 5

Therefore, John can buy 5 more lego sets with the remaining money. The number of lego sets he still has is:

1. **First Month:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as in the first month.
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   First, calculate 30% of 180.
   \[
   0.30 \times 180 = 54

   Subtract this from the second month's downloads to get the third month's downloads.

1. **Number of dogs**: The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Number of cats**: The number of cats is twice the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Combined number of dogs and cats**: The combined number of dogs and cats is:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Number of rabbits**: The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Total number of pets**: The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

69,116,ar,"To determine how much money Bailey started with, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the amount of money Bailey initially had.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Bailey received from her weekly allowance over 8 weeks.
3. Set up an equation that represents the total amount of money Bailey has at the end of 8 weeks.
4. Solve the equation for \( x \).

Let's start with the calculation:

1. Bailey initially has \( x \) dollars.
2. She receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. Therefore, she receives \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.
3. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 40 = 100
   \]
4. To find \( x \), subtract 40 from both sides:
   \[
   x + 40 - 40 = 100 - 40
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:

1. **Calculate the number of kittens Patchy has had:**
   - Patchy has had three times the number of kittens adopted from the animal shelter.
   - The number of kittens adopted is 7.
   - Therefore, Patchy has had \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kittens.

2. **Calculate the number of kittens Trixie has had:**
   - Trixie has had 12 kittens.

3. **Calculate the total number of kittens from Patchy and Trixie:**
   - Add the number of kittens Patchy has had to the number of kittens Trixie has had.
   - Total from Patchy and Trixie = \( 21 + 12 = 33 \) kittens.

4. **Calculate the final total number of kittens:**
   - Add the 7 kittens adopted from the animal shelter to the 33 kittens from Patchy and Trixie.
   - Final total = \( 7 + 33 = 40 \) kittens.

1. **Original number of cars on the motorway:**
   There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that took an exit:**
   5 cars took an exit, so they don't have to drive through the traffic jam. Therefore, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:**
   20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

4. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes:**
   The number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:

\[
\text{Calories per serving} = 250 \text{ calories}
\]

\[
\text{Calories per serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories}

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can consume without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[
2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

Since the bag of chips contains 250 calories per serving, we need to calculate how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories:

\[

88,132,ar,"Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald sold. 

According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Therefore, the number of copies sold by Marilyn's record is \( 10 \times H \).

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. We can set up the following equation to represent this information:

\[
H + 10 \times H = 88,000
\]

Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

\[
11 \times H = 88,000
\]

To find \( H \), divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[
H = \frac{88,000}{11}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
H = 8,000
\]

Thus, the number of copies Harald sold is \( 8,000 \).

The final answer within \boxed{} is:

\[
8,000

First, calculate the cost of the donuts:

\[ \text{Cost of donuts} = 3 \times 68 = 204 \]

Next, calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:

\[ \text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Then, calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:

- The cost per dozen is $55.
\[ \text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = 6 \times 55 = 330 \]

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is \(40\), so:
   \[
   40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(20\), so:
   \[
   80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we sum up the guesses of all three friends:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

The average guess is the sum of the guesses divided by the number of friends, which is 3:
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80

2. Starting from the 21st year, she gets an additional 5% of the pension value each year.
3. For the first 20 years, her annual pension remains at $50,000.
4. For the next 10 years, she gets an additional 5% of the pension value.
5. We need to determine the exact value of the pension at the start of the 21st year, but since the problem only asks for the annual pension after 30 years, we can ignore the exact value of the pension.
6. Therefore, her annual pension for the first 20 years remains $50,000.
7. For the next 10 years, she gets an additional 5% of the pension value each year, which is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year.
8. Thus, her annual pension after 30 years is $2,500.

4. She spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. Therefore, she spends \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours running and \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours walking.
5. Calculate the distance she runs in 6 hours: \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12\) miles.
6. Calculate the distance she walks in 6 hours: \(1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6\) miles.

   - Given there are 60 girls, the number of boys is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls.

3. **Determine the ratio of students to teachers:**
   - The ratio of students to teachers is 5:1.

4. **Calculate the number of teachers:**
   - Since there are 5 students for every teacher, the number of teachers can be calculated by dividing the total number of students by 5.

67,156,ar,"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - There are twice the number of emeralds than rubies.
   \[
   \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems:
\[
\text{Total number of gems} = 175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

39,164,ar,"Given:
- Dana skips at 3 miles per hour.
- She runs at twice the speed she skips, so she runs at \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.
- She walks at a speed that is one-fourth of her running speed, so she walks at \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Let's calculate the time Dana spends running and walking:
- Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
- Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
- Distance while running: Speed × Time = 6 miles/hour × 2 hours = 12 miles.
- Distance while walking: Speed × Time = 1.5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 6 miles.

Finally, the total distance she can travel in six hours is:
- Total distance = Distance while running + Distance while walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

\[
2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
\]

Next, we need to figure out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. We do this by dividing the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per set:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:

\[
15 \text{ sets} \times 5.00 \text{ dollars/set} = 75.00 \text{ dollars}

   - Total calories per serving = 250 calories
   - Number of servings in the bag = 5
   - Total calories per gram = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings/bag = 1250 calories per bag

2. Calculate the number of calories you can consume:

   - Calories already consumed = 1800 calories
   - Calories left to consume = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

3. Calculate the number of grams you can eat to consume 200 calories:

Next, we need to find out how much weight is left to remove after removing the comic books. The total weight he needs to remove is 15 pounds. Subtracting the weight of the comic books from this total gives:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since each toy weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound, we can determine the number of toys needed to remove 7.5 pounds by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[

1. **Calculate the volume of tomatoes needed before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume.
   - Therefore, the volume of tomatoes needed before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Volume of tomatoes needed before cooking = 2 * 32 ounces = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of cans of tomatoes needed:**
   - Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces.
   - The number of cans required is the total volume of tomatoes needed divided by the volume of one can.
   - Number of cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

3. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - The total number of tomatoes is the number of cans multiplied by the number of tomatoes per can.
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

1. Calculate the cost of one red tie.
2. Determine the number of blue ties John bought.
3. Calculate the cost of one blue tie.
4. Determine the number of red ties John bought.
5. Calculate the total cost of all the ties.

1. The cost of one red tie is 50% more than the cost of one blue tie.
2. Since John bought $200 worth of blue ties at $40 each, the number of blue ties he bought is $200/$40 = 5.
3. The cost of one blue tie is $40.
4. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he buys 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.
5. The cost of one red tie is $40 * 1.5 = $60. Therefore, the total cost of the red ties is 10 * $60 = $600.

Adding these costs together gives us a total of $200 + $600 = 800 dollars.",800,0,

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week.

\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

**Step 2: Convert the eggs into dozens.**

There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells each dozen eggs for $2.

1. Calculate the cost of the chicken meal.
2. Calculate the cost of the 5 packs of milk.
3. Calculate the cost of the 4 apples.
4. Subtract the total cost of the items except for pizza from the total amount paid.
5. Divide the remaining amount by the cost per box of pizza to find the number of boxes.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of the 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of the 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.
4. The total cost of the items except for pizza is \(12 + 15 + 6 = 33\) dollars.
5. The remaining amount is $50 - 33 = $17.

2. **Cost for the jeweler:**

   \$800

3. **Total cost before insurance:**

4. **Insurance cost:**
   \[

First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days:
\[
1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of dog food used in the remaining 365 days:
\[
2 \text{ cups/day} \times 365 \text{ days} = 730 \text{ cups}
\]

Adding these two amounts:
\[
180 \text{ cups} + 730 \text{ cups} = 910 \text{ cups}
\]

Since one bag contains 110 cups:
\[
\frac{910 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 8 \text{ bags}

1. **Number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Number of cats:**
   The problem states that there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

4. **Total number of pets:**
   To find the total number of pets, we sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

- Market increase: 1.2%
- Increase in value: \( 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \)
- New value of electronic gadgets: \( 8000 + 96 = 8096 \)

To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the purchase plan that offers the higher expected value. In this case, the electronic gadgets purchase plan results in a new value of $8,096.

The profit from this purchase plan is:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written each day.**

- On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, she wrote:
  \[
  5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}

- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, she wrote:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles.**

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent is:

Finally, we calculate the revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so the total revenue per week is:

1. Calculate the distance Tom traveled while sailing from 1 PM to 4 PM.
2. Determine the distance Tom needs to travel to return to his starting point.
3. Calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled:
- Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
- He sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.

Next, since Tom is returning to his starting point, the distance he needs to travel is the same as the distance he traveled away, which is 30 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back:
- Tom travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.
- Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, the time it takes for Tom to get back is:

72,236,ar,"To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling brownies and the total revenue from selling cheesecakes separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.
- Therefore, the total revenue from brownies is:
  \[
  43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.
- Therefore, the total revenue from cheesecakes is:
  \[
  23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we sum the revenues from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money raised:
\[
129 \text{ dollars} + 92 \text{ dollars} = 221 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

12,244,ar,"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to compare the cost of planting the tree to the annual revenue from selling the lemons after accounting for the annual expenses.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling the lemons each year:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.50 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.50 \]

Next, we subtract the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree from this revenue:
\[ \$10.50 - \$3.00 = \$7.50 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net annual revenue to equal or exceed the initial cost of $90.

We set up the following inequality:
\[ \$7.50 \times \text{number of years} \geq \$90 \]

Solving for the number of years:
\[ \text{number of years} \geq \frac{\$90}{\$7.50} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.",13,0,

1. Calculate the number of boys at the school.
2. Determine the total number of students at the school.
3. Calculate the number of teachers based on the ratio of students to teachers.

First, we know that there are 60 girls at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of girls and the number of boys:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

We are given that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5:
\[
\text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36
\]

Thus, the number of teachers at the school is:

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen donuts cost $68.
- So, the cost of donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen mini cupcakes cost $80.
- So, the cost of mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen mini cheesecakes cost $55.
- So, the cost of mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\).

1. **Calculate the number of sprints James runs in a week:**
   - James runs 3 sprints each day.
   - He runs 3 times a week.
   - Therefore, the number of sprints he runs in a week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ sprints/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one sprint:**
   - Each sprint is 60 meters long.

3. **Calculate the total distance James runs in a week:**
   - He runs 9 sprints each week.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters long.
   - Therefore, the total distance he runs in a week is:

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
- Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
- Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
- Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire eats in one day. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day.

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, she will have eaten:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.",7,0,

2. Determine the annual increase in salary.
3. Apply the annual increase three times to find her new salary.

**Step 1: Calculate Sylvie's initial annual salary.**

Sylvie's monthly salary is $600, so her initial annual salary is:
\[ 600 \times 12 = 7200 \]

**Step 2: Determine the annual increase in salary.**

The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year. Therefore, the annual increase is:
\[ 0.10 \times 7200 = 720 \]

**Step 3: Apply the annual increase three times to find her new salary.**

After three years, her salary will increase by:
\[ 720 \times 3 = 2160 \]

So, her new salary is:

1. **Determine the number of sheep each city has:**
   - We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore,
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80

2. **Calculate the total number of sheep:**
   - Add the number of sheep in each city:
     \[
     \text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

87,276,ar,"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial monthly salary.
2. Calculate the increase in salary for each additional year of service.
3. Compute the new monthly salary after three more years of service.
4. Convert the new monthly salary to an annual salary.

1. The initial monthly salary is $600.
2. The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year. Therefore, the salary increase for each additional year is \( 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \) dollars.
3. After three more years, the total increase in salary is \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \) dollars. Adding this increase to the initial salary gives \( 600 + 180 = 780 \) dollars per month.
4. To find the annual salary, multiply the monthly salary by 12: \( 780 \times 12 = 9360 \) dollars.

Thus, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $9360.",9360,0,

53,284,ar,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both days and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each.
- On Thursday, the mechanic also repaired 4 car tires at $40 each.
- Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: \(6 \times 60 = 360\)
- Revenue from car tires on Thursday: \(4 \times 40 = 160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\)

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each.
- Revenue from car tires on Friday: \(12 \times 40 = 480\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(480\)

Now, let's find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- Difference in revenue: \(520 - 480 = 40\)

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue for Thursday.**
- On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360
  \]
- On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160
  \]
- Total revenue for Thursday:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue for Friday.**
- On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday.**
- Difference in revenue:
  \[
  520 - 480 = 40

1. Calculate the total number of dance classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from each student.
4. Multiply the total number of students by the revenue per student to find the total weekly revenue.

First, let's find the total number of dance classes Judy teaches in a week:
- From Monday to Friday, she teaches 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of dance classes is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Next, we calculate the total number of students in a week:
- Each class has 15 students.

The total number of students is 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Now, we calculate the revenue from each student:
- Judy charges $15.00 per student.

The total revenue is 495 students * $15/student = $7425",7425,0,

2. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon sells for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. So, the net annual profit is:
   \[
   10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to divide the initial cost by the net annual profit.
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Initial cost}}{\text{Net annual profit}} = \frac{90}{7.5}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
   \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

1. Determine the number of jelly beans each friend thinks are in the jar.
2. Add up all the guesses.
3. Divide the total number of guesses by the number of friends to get the average.

First, let's calculate each friend's guess:
- The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess: \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80 \) jelly beans.
- The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess: \( 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses:
\[ 80 + 80 + 100 = 260 \]

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes Candice had in her purse from the total number of Post-it notes used to find the number of Post-it notes she purchased.

First, we know that Candice placed a Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee and had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she used is:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Next, we know that Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. To find out how many Post-it notes she purchased, we subtract the number of Post-it notes she had in her purse from the total number of Post-it notes she used:
\[ 243 - 80 = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is:

\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the remaining 180 days. Each day, the puppy consumes 2 cups:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 360 \text{ cups} \]

Now, let's sum the total amount of dog food consumed over the entire year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, let's determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use. Each bag contains 110 cups:
\[ \frac{540 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

- Let \( W \) be the number of games won.
- Let \( L \) be the number of games lost.

We know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these two pieces of information as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games.",15,0,

12,340,ar,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net earnings and compare it to the initial cost of planting the tree.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.50 \]

Next, we subtract the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree to find the net annual earnings:
\[ \$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50 \]

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net earnings to exceed the initial cost of $90. Let \( y \) be the number of years it takes.

The equation to solve is:
\[ \$7.50 \times y > \$90 \]

To solve for \( y \):
\[ y > \frac{\$90}{\$7.50} \]
\[ y > 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos more than 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means:
  \[
  \left(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5\right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means:
  \[

  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours spent writing over the three days:
\[
5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[
26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}

Thus, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:

1. Identify the original cost of the grooming.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The original cost of the grooming is $100.
2. The discount is 30%, which means we need to find 30% of $100. We do this by multiplying $100 by 0.30 (since 30% is the same as 0.30 in decimal form).
   \[
   100 \times 0.30 = 30
   \]
   So, the discount amount is $30.
3. To find the final cost, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost.
   \[
   100 - 30 = 70
   \]
   Therefore, the final cost of the grooming is $70.

Putting it all together, we get:

\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Finally, we calculate the revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \]

1. Grace weighs 125 pounds.
2. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.

Let's break down the steps:

1. Calculate Alex's weight:
   - 4 times Grace's weight: \( 4 \times 125 \)
   - 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight: \( 4 \times 125 - 2 \)

2. Perform the multiplication and subtraction:
   - \( 4 \times 125 = 500 \)
   - \( 500 - 2 = 498 \)

Therefore, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

3. Calculate their combined weights:
   - Grace's weight: 125 pounds
   - Alex's weight: 498 pounds
   - Combined weight: \( 125 + 498 = 623 \)

Thus, the combined weights of Grace and Alex are:

1. Calculate the increase in salary for each year.
2. Apply the increase for three more years.
3. Multiply the final monthly salary by 12 to get the annual salary.

**Step 1: Calculate the increase in salary.**

The initial monthly salary is $600, and the company increases the salary by 10% every year. Therefore, the increase in salary for each year is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

**Step 2: Apply the increase for three more years.**

After three years, the total increase in salary is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

So, the new monthly salary after three years is:
\[ 600 + 180 = 780 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the annual salary.**

To find the annual salary, multiply the monthly salary by 12:
\[ 780 \times 12 = 9360 \",9360,0,

36,380,ar,"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for 30 yogurts.

First, we know Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we know the yogurt is on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. Therefore, the cost per yogurt is:
\[ \frac{5 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

   - Blue ties cost $40 each and he spent $200 on them.
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5

2. Determine the number of red ties John buys:
   - He buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10

3. Calculate the cost of each red tie:
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - Blue ties cost $40 each, so 50% of $40 is 0.5 * $40 = $20.
   - Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20 = $60

4. Calculate the total cost of all the ties:
   - Total cost = (Number of blue ties * Cost per blue tie) + (Number of red ties * Cost per red tie)
   - Total cost = (5 * $40) + (10 * $60) = $200 + $600 = $800",800,0,

1. Calculate the total amount of money Bailey received from her allowance over the 8 weeks.
2. Subtract the total allowance from the total amount of money Bailey has at the end of the 8 weeks to find out how much she started with.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Bailey received from her allowance:
\[ \text{Total allowance} = \text{Weekly allowance} \times \text{Number of weeks} \]
\[ \text{Total allowance} = 5 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Total allowance} = 40 \]

Next, we subtract the total allowance from the total amount of money Bailey has at the end of the 8 weeks:
\[ \text{Amount started with} = \text{Total money at the end} - \text{Total allowance} \]
\[ \text{Amount started with} = 100 - 40 \]
\[ \text{Amount started with} = 60 \]

This means she has walked 4+2=6 miles in total. Now, we need to find out how long it will take her to walk the remaining 6 miles to get her average speed to 4 miles per hour. We know that average speed is distance divided by time, and she has a total of 12 miles to go, so 12-6=6 miles left. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, then it will take her 6/4=1.5 hours to walk the remaining 6 miles. 

We also know that speed is distance divided by time, and she has 6-2=1.5 miles left to walk, and it will take her 1.5 hours. So, she needs to walk at a speed of 1.5/1.5=1 mile per hour for the remaining distance.

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we find the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 \times 1.5 = 60 \]

The total cost for the red ties is:

\[ \text{Total cost for red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the blue and red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost for all ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

He then turns around and drives the same distance back, so he drives another 180 miles.
After the 180-mile round trip, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he is at the same point.
He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, which means he covers 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
He then spends the remaining half-hour driving at a speed of 80 mph, which means he covers 80 * 0.5 = 40 miles.
In total, John has driven 180 + 180 + 15 + 40 = 415 miles.

86,404,ar,"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to break down the problem into steps and calculate the number of rings for each instance.

1. **First ring:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second ring:**
   - The alarm rang three times as long as the first time.
   - Since the first ring lasted for 4 rings, three times as long means:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ rings}
     \]

3. **Third ring:**
   - The alarm rang half as long as the second time.
   - Since the second ring lasted for 12 rings, half as long means:
     \[
     \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ rings}
     \]

Now, we sum up the rings from all three instances:
\[
4 \text{ (first ring)} + 12 \text{ (second ring)} + 6 \text{ (third ring)} = 22
\]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is:

19,412,ar,"First, we need to determine the total distance Marissa has already walked and the total time she has taken.

1. She walked 4 miles in the first 1 hour.
2. She walked 2 miles in the next 1 hour.

Total distance walked = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
Total time taken = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Next, we calculate the average speed she wants to achieve:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 12 miles / 2 hours = 6 miles per hour

However, she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. This discrepancy is due to the fact that she walked 6 miles in 2 hours.

We need to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining time. We can do this by subtracting her current average speed from her desired average speed:

Required speed = Desired average speed - Current average speed
Required speed = 6 miles per hour - 4 miles per hour = 2 miles per hour

Therefore, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is \(2\) miles per hour.",6,0,

- She walked 4 miles in the first hour.
- She walked 2 miles in the second hour.

- She has already walked 6 miles.
- So, the remaining distance is \(12 - 6 = 6\) miles.

Since she has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, the remaining time is \(2 - 2 = 0\) hours.

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 0 hours. This means she needs to walk the entire trail in 2 hours.

Therefore, the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance is:

1. Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the net profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles. Since each candle requires one pound of beeswax and wicks, and one pound costs $10.00, the total cost for 20 pounds is:
\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue for 20 candles is:
\[
20 \times 2 = 40
\]

Now, we subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the net profit:
\[
40 - 200 = -160

First, let's calculate the annual earnings from selling lemons:
- The tree grows 7 lemons each year.
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- Annual earnings per year = 7 lemons * $1.5/lmon = $10.5.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.
- Annual cost per year = $3.

Now, let's find the net earnings per year:
- Net earnings per year = Annual earnings - Annual cost
- Net earnings per year = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

The initial cost to plant the tree is $90. To find out how many years it will take for the net earnings to cover the initial cost, we divide the initial cost by the net earnings per year:
- Number of years = $90 / $7.5/year = 12 years.

2. She walked the next 2 miles in the second hour.

So, the total distance walked is \(4 + 2 = 6\) miles.

Next, let's calculate the total time taken to walk the distance she has already walked.

- The first hour took \(1\) hour.
- The second hour took \(1\) hour.

So, the total time is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, let's determine the remaining distance she needs to walk. The total trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so the remaining distance is \(12 - 6 = 6\) miles.

Finally, let's calculate the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance. Her average speed should be 4 miles per hour for the entire trail. To achieve this, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in \(2\) hours.

\[
\text{Speed for remaining 6 miles} = \frac{6}{2} = 3

51,428,ar,"First, we need to determine the total distance Tom's ship travels from 1 PM to 4 PM. The ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

1. Calculate the time from 1 PM to 4 PM:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 4 \text{ PM} - 1 \text{ PM} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. Calculate the distance traveled:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

Now, we know that the ship travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. To find the time it takes to travel back, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the time it takes Tom to get back is:

\[
\text{Total interest} = 5 \times 30 = 150

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80

Next, we find the number of girls. Since there are 200 students in total and 80 are boys, the number of girls is:

\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we calculate the number of girls in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we find:
\[
\text{Number of girls in girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80

Finally, we determine the number of girls not in the girl scout by subtracting the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through, so the number of cars remaining is \( 30 - x \).

After the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through, so the number of cars driving through now is \( 20 \).

Next, 5 cars take an exit, so the number of cars remaining is \( (30 - x) + 20 - 5 = 45 - x \).

We are given that the number of cars remaining is the same as the number of cars originally on the motorway, which is 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
45 - x = 30
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
45 - 30 = x

\[
x = 15

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(15\).",5,0,

2. **Points in the second 20 minutes:**

33,452,ar,"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we start by defining the number of silver coins as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins can be expressed as \( G = S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is given as 110. This can be expressed as:
\[
S + G = 110
\]

Substituting the expression for \( G \) into the equation, we get:
\[
S + (S + 30) = 110
\]

Simplifying this equation, we find:
\[
2S + 30 = 110
\]
\[
2S = 80
\]
\[
S = 40
\]

Now, we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting \( S \) back into the expression for \( G \):
\[
G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70
\]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.",70,0,

49,460,ar,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.
\[
\text{Total number of units} = 15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Next, we calculate the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied:
\[
\text{Number of occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Now, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:
\[
\text{Number of unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units is:

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694

First, calculate the salary increase for the first year:

So, her salary after the first year is:
\[
600 + 60 = 660

Next, calculate the salary increase for the second year:

So, her salary after the second year is:
\[
660 + 66 = 726

Finally, calculate the salary increase for the third year:

Now, we know she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire trail. If her average speed is 4 miles per hour over the entire 12 miles, then the total time she should take to walk the entire trail is 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours. 

Marissa already spent 2 hours walking, so she needs to walk the remaining 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour. 

The remaining distance she needs to walk is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles. 

To find the required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour. 

Therefore, she needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.",6,0,

- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep Seattle has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of sheep Charleston has.
- Let \( T \) be the number of sheep Toulouse has.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so \( C = 4 \times S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so \( T = 2 \times C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \).

Now, we can find the total number of sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together by adding the number of sheep each has:

\[
S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep.

1. **Cost of the material:**
   Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch.

2. **Cost of the jeweler:**
   Janet pays $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Insurance cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost for insurance. First, we need to find the total cost before insurance.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before insurance} = 500 + 800 = 1300
   \]
   The insurance cost is 10% of $1300.
   \[
   \text{Insurance cost} = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130

47,492,ar,"First, let's determine the number of blue ties John bought. We know that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties.

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of one red tie. The cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie.

\[
\text{Cost of one red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we find the total cost of all the ties by adding the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 200 + (10 \times 60) = 200 + 600 = 800

Next, let's determine her walking speed. Since she can run at a rate that is four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much time she spends running and walking. If she spends one-third of the time running, she spends \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours running. If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, she spends \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours walking.

The total distance she runs is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) miles. The total distance she walks is \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) miles. Adding these distances together gives us the total distance she travels in six hours, which is \(12 + 6 = 18\) miles.",18,0,

First, let's calculate her annual earnings as a teacher:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.

\[
\text{Annual earnings as a teacher} = 20 \times 35 \times 50 = 35000
\]

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings as a coach:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.

\[
\text{Annual earnings as a coach} = 30 \times 15 \times 50 = 22500
\]

Now, we sum her earnings from both jobs to find her total annual salary:
\[
\text{Total annual salary} = 35000 + 22500 = 57500

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know there are two cats for every dog.
   - Given: Number of dogs = 60
   - Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs = 2 * 60 = 120

2. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats = 60 + 120 = 180
   - Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
   - Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(348\).",348,0,

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:

\]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[
\text{Water in remaining orange drink} = 6 - 1 = 5 \text{ liters}

First, let's find out how many hours John runs each day:
- On the first day, John runs for 3 hours.
- On the second day, John runs for \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- On the third day, John runs for \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time John spends running in a week:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know John runs a total of 60 miles a week. To find his running speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

1. Determine the square footage of each level.
2. Calculate the total square footage of all levels.
3. Divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average.

Let's start with the square footage of each level:
- The top level has a square footage of 16.
- The second level has half the square footage of the top level, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).
- The third level has half the square footage of the second level, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).
- The bottom level has half the square footage of the third level, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

Now, we calculate the total square footage of all levels:

2. Calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children.
3. Add the amounts needed for both adults and children to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.
- Therefore, the amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 10 pounds/adult * 20 adults = 200 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds.
- There are 5 children.
- Therefore, the amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 pounds/child * 5 children = 25 pounds.

Finally, add the amounts needed for both adults and children to get the total amount:
- Total amount needed = 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

2. **Calculate the number of girls:**

1. Calculate the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip:
   - The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip.
   - The total trip is 60 miles.
   - Therefore, the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip is \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) miles.

2. Calculate the distance from the start of the trip to the first stop:
   - The first stop is after 20 miles.
   - The distance from the start of the trip to the first stop is 20 miles.

3. Subtract the distance from the start of the trip to the first stop from the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip:

Now, we determine the number of red ties John bought. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie:

24,556,ar,"To find the original price of the book, we need to reverse the discount process. A 25% discount means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Step 1: Understand the relationship between the original price and the discounted price.
The discounted price is 75% of the original price. Therefore, the discounted price can be written as:
\[ 0.75P \]

Step 2: Set up the equation using the given discounted price.
We know the discounted price is $19.50. So, we can write:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

Step 3: Solve for \( P \).
To find \( P \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Step 4: Perform the division.
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(26.00\).",26,0,

   - Cooking the tomatoes loses half their volume.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes used is:
     \[
     \text{Original volume} = 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}

2. **Determine the number of cans used:**

   - To find out how many cans were used, we divide the original volume by the volume of one can:
     \[
     \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}

- On Tuesday, she wrote 5 + (2/5) * 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:

Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Finally, we calculate the total number of hours she spent writing those articles. Each article takes 4 hours to research and write:

Total hours = 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

63,572,ar,"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the costs for the first six months and the last six months.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first six months. The service charges $140 per month, so for six months, the cost is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the last six months. The service charges 10% less than the initial amount for the last six months. To find 10% of $140, we subtract that from $140:
\[ 140 - 140 \times 0.10 = 140 - 14 = 126 \]
So, the cost for the last six months is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we add the costs for both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

So, the first 80 GB will be downloaded in:

Next, Carla has to restart after 40 minutes. This restart takes 20 minutes, so the total time for this phase is:

After the restart, Carla downloads the remaining 20% of the file, which is 40 GB. The time for this phase is:

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204

So, the mini cupcakes cost $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.

So, the mini cupcakes cost $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330

Since she has already walked all 6 miles in 0 hours, we need to find out how much time she has left to walk the remaining 6 miles:

Since Marissa's average speed for the entire trail is 4 miles per hour and she has already walked 6 miles, we need to find out how much time she has left to walk the remaining 6 miles:

The discount on the book is 25%, which means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. We know that this 75% of the original price equals $19.50. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = 19.50 \times \frac{100}{75} \]
\[ P = 19.50 \times 1.33333 \]
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount paid for the first half of the year, which is 6 months:

\[ \text{Total amount for the first half} = 6 \times 140 = 840 \]

Then, we calculate the total amount paid for the second half of the year, which is also 6 months:

1. **Total time spent on TV and reading per day:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours each day.
   - Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on TV and reading per day is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours.

2. **Total time spent on TV and reading per week:**
   - Jim does this routine 3 times a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on TV and reading per week is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) hours.

3. **Total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks:**
   - Jim does this routine for 4 weeks.

61,596,ar,"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to break down the expenses and sum them up.

1. **Cost of the material:**
   Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch.

2. **Cost for the jeweler:**
   Janet pays $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Insurance cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost to get the brooch insured. First, we find the total cost of the material and the jeweler:
   \[
   500 + 800 = 1300
   \]
   Then, we calculate 10% of $1300:
   \[
   0.10 \times 1300 = 130
   \]

Now, we sum up all the expenses to find the total amount Janet paid:
\[
500 + 800 + 130 = 1430

**Step 1: Calculate the number of players in each team.**
- Each team has 5 players.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of players in each school.**
- Each school has 2 teams (one girls' team and one boys' team).
- Number of players per team: 5
- Total number of players per school: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \)

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of coaches in each school.**
- Each school has one coach for each team.
- Number of coaches per school: 1

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people per school.**
- Total people per school: Number of players + Number of coaches
- Total people per school = 10 + 1 = 11

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of people sent by all four schools.**
- Total people = Total people per school × Number of schools

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cell phones:**
   Each cell phone costs $150, and Shiela bought five of them.
   \[
   5 \times 150 = 750

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

John spends 8 video games, each costing $20.
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

John buys $160 on video games and has $5 left, which means he initially had:
\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since John spends all the money from selling his lego sets, and he had $165 initially, he must have spent:
\[ 165 - 160 = 5 \]

So, John spent $5 on his lego sets, which means he had:
\[ 195 - 5 = 190 \]
from selling his lego sets.

Since he sells each lego set for $15, he sold:
\[ \frac{190}{15} = 13 \]
lego sets. 

Therefore, John still has 13 lego sets.

38,604,ar,"First, we need to determine how many hours John runs in a week.

1. On the first day, John runs for 3 hours.
2. On the second day, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs for \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
3. On the third day, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs for \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours he runs each day:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know John runs 60 miles a week. To find his running speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

43,628,ar,"1. Calculate the total calories in a 300g bag of chips:
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings.
   - Therefore, the total calories in a 300g bag is \(250 \times 5 = 1250\) calories.

2. Determine the remaining calorie target after consuming 1800 calories:
   - The daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - So, the remaining calorie target is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

3. Calculate the number of grams that can be eaten with the remaining calorie target:
   - Since 1250 calories come from 300g, the calories per gram are \(\frac{1250}{300} = 0.25\) calories per gram.
   - Therefore, with 200 calories, you can eat \(\frac{200}{0.25} = 800\) grams.",48,0,

2,636,ar,"Josh buys a house for $80,000 and puts in $50,000 in repairs, increasing the value by 150%. First, we calculate the increased value of the house:

\[
\text{Increased value} = \text{Original value} + 150\% \text{ of } \text{Original value}
\]

\[
\text{Increased value} = 80,000 + 1.5 \times 80,000 = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
\]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the initial cost of buying the house from the increased value:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Increased value} - \text{Initial cost}
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = 200,000 - 80,000 = 120,000
\]

Thus, Josh made a profit of $120,000.

   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we can calculate Raymond's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is calculated by subtracting David's laundry from Raymond's laundry.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}

\[
2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ potted plants}
\]

Adding the new potted plants to the ones she already has, we get:

\[
18 + 80 = 98 \text{ potted plants}
\]

Next, Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges. Since she has 40 window ledges and she will give away 1 potted plant from each, the number of potted plants she will give away is:

\[
40 \times 1 = 40 \text{ potted plants}
\]

Subtracting the potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she has, we get:

\[
98 - 40 = 58
\]

Thus, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.

So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[ 6 \times 55 = 330 \]

   - First 4 miles: 1 hour
   - Next 2 miles: 1 hour
   - Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

2. Determine the total distance she needs to walk: 
   - 12 miles

3. Calculate the remaining distance: 
   - Distance already walked: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

4. Determine the required speed to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
   - Total time: 2 hours
   - Average speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Required speed = Distance / Time = 6 miles / (total time - 2 hours)

   Since the total time is 2 hours, the remaining time to complete 6 miles is:
   - Remaining time = 2 hours - 2 hours = 0 hours

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.
\[
\text{Total number of units} = 15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Next, we determine the number of occupied units. Given that \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the building is occupied, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:
\[
\text{Number of unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30

1. If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Let's denote the total value of the pension as \( V \).

Since Marcy is working for 30 years, she is not yet eligible for the full annual pension of $50,000. Instead, she is eligible for 5% of the value of the pension per year.

However, the problem does not specify the total value of the pension. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact amount of her annual pension from the given information.

Given that the problem does not provide the total value of the pension, we cannot determine the exact amount of her annual pension. Therefore, the problem as stated is incomplete and cannot be solved.

90,668,ar,"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds.
- There are 20 adults.
\[
20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult. Therefore, each child eats 5 pounds (since \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \)).
- There are 5 children.
\[
5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we add the amounts needed for the adults and the children:
\[
200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = 225 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

1. **Cindy's Pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's Pets:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Jan's Pets:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Total Number of Pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28

   - Total calories per 300g = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

2. Calculate the remaining calories allowed:
   - Daily calorie target = 2000 calories.
   - Calories already consumed = 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. Determine how many grams of chips can be eaten with the remaining calories:
   - Each 300g bag contains 1250 calories.
   - To find out how many grams you can eat for 200 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per 300g:

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy consumes 1 cup per day.
2. For the remaining days (365 days), the puppy consumes 2 cups per day.

So, the total consumption for the first year is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} + 365 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} \]
\[ = 180 \text{ cups} + 730 \text{ cups} \]
\[ = 910 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required to cover 910 cups, given that one bag contains 110 cups.

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{910 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 8 \]

31,700,ar,"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate each guess and then find the average.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend's guess is \(40 + 20 = 60\) jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so the third friend's guess is \(80 + 20 = 100\) jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

To find the average, we divide the total number of guesses by the number of friends:
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar is \(80\).",80,0,

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house:

2. She sold 2 more to the red house:
   \[

3. She sold half of what was left to the orange house:

After these sales, she is left with 5 vacuum cleaners:
\[

- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She then took another hour to walk the next 2 miles.

So, the total time spent is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Next, let's determine the total distance Marissa has walked:

- She walked 4 miles initially.
- Then she walked 2 more miles.

Thus, the total distance walked is \(4 + 2 = 6\) miles.

Now, we need to find out how much distance she has left to walk:

- The total distance of the trail is 12 miles.
- She has already walked 6 miles.

Therefore, the remaining distance to be walked is \(12 - 6 = 6\) miles.

Finally, let's calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

- She wants the average speed to be 4 miles per hour.
- The remaining distance is 6 miles.

So, the required speed is \(6 - 4 = 2\) miles per hour.

87,716,ar,"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow the steps:

1. Calculate the increase in salary each year.
2. Determine the total increase in salary over three years.
3. Add the total increase to the initial salary to get the new salary.

First, let's calculate the increase in salary each year. The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year. The initial salary is $600, so the increase in salary each year is:
\[ 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \]

Next, we determine the total increase in salary over three years. Since the increase per year is $60, the total increase over three years is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

Finally, we add the total increase to the initial salary to get the new salary. The initial salary is $600, so the new salary is:
\[ 600 + 180 = 780 \]

Therefore, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary is $780.",9360,0,

1. Calculate the total amount John has after selling his lego sets.
2. Subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money from the total amount.
3. Determine how many lego sets John still has after buying the video games.

First, calculate the total amount John has after selling his lego sets:
\[
13 \times 15 = 195
\]

Next, subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money from the total amount. The cost of the 8 video games is:
\[
8 \times 20 = 160
\]
The remaining money is $5, so:
\[
195 - 160 - 5 = 30
\]

Now, determine how many lego sets John still has with the remaining $30. Each lego set is sold for $15, so:
\[
\frac{30}{15} = 2

Thus, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[
\frac{18}{3} = 6

So, if he buys 6 packages at $2.50 each:

- Buying in packages of 2: $9

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of all the ties:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 40 + 10 \times 60 = 200 + 600 = 800

1. **Initial number of cars on the motorway:**
   There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that took an exit:**
   5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:**
   20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

4. **Calculate the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes:**
   The number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is the total number of cars that drove through the jam minus the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:
   \[
   25 - 20 = 5
   \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by her ducks per day.
2. Determine how many eggs Janet uses for breakfast and baking each day.
3. Calculate the number of eggs remaining after using some for breakfast and baking.
4. Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs at the farmers' market.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes 4 eggs for her friends every day. So, she uses a total of:
   \[
   3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs}
   \]
3. The number of eggs remaining after using some for breakfast and baking is:
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]
4. Janet sells each remaining egg for $2. Therefore, the total revenue per day is:
   \[
   9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars}

1. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. To find the number of additional articles she wrote, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \text{ more articles}
   \]
   Therefore, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles on Wednesday}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles over the three days. Each article takes 4 hours to research and write, so the total number of hours is:
\[
5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours per article} = 104 \text{ hours}

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per day.
2. Determine the number of eggs produced per week.
3. Convert the number of eggs into dozens.
4. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per day.
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

Step 2: Determine the number of eggs produced per week.
There are 7 days in a week, so the number of eggs produced per week is:
\[ 252 \times 7 = 1764 \]

Step 3: Convert the number of eggs into dozens.
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the number of dozens of eggs is:
\[ \frac{1764}{12} = 147 \]

Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.
Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2, so the total revenue per week is:
\[ 147 \times 2 = 294 \]

- Orange drink:
  - Total: 10 liters
  - Percentage water: two-thirds
  - Water content: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = 6 \) liters

- Pineapple drink:
  - Total: 15 liters
  - Percentage water: three-fifths
  - Water content: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters

Next, we calculate the total amount of water before any spills:

- Total water content = Water in orange drink + Water in pineapple drink
  - Total water content = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters

We then account for the spill:

- Spilled orange drink: 1 liter (which contains 2/3 water)
  - Water content in spilled orange drink: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = 2/3 \) liters

Thus, the total water content after the spill:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced in a week.
2. Determine the number of dozens in the weekly egg production.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs produced in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily egg production by 7:

\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs are in this weekly production. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the eggs is:

- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her running speed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.
- Her walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Let's calculate how many miles she travels in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

First, calculate the time spent running:
- Time spent running = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.

Next, calculate the time spent walking:
- Time spent walking = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

Now, calculate the distance traveled by each activity:
- Distance while running = Speed × Time = 6 miles/hour × 2 hours = 12 miles.
- Distance while walking = Speed × Time = 1.5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 6 miles.

Finally, sum the distances to find the total distance traveled:
- Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = \text{Number of pets Cindy has} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Jan's Pets:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of pets each person has:
\[
\text{Total pets} = \text{Number of pets Jan has} + \text{Number of pets Marcia has} + \text{Number of pets Cindy has} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
\]

In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam. So, after the remaining 15 minutes, there are \( (30 - x) + 20 = 50 - x \) cars on the motorway.

Now, 5 cars take an exit so they don't have to drive through the traffic jam. Therefore, the number of cars that actually drive through the traffic jam is \( (50 - x) - 5 = 45 - x \).

We know that the number of cars that originally lined up on the motorway is 30, so we have:
\[ 45 - x = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 45 - 30 = x \]
\[ 15 = x \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(15\).",5,0,

1. Determine the number of boys at the school.
2. Calculate the total number of students at the school.
3. Determine the number of teachers based on the given ratio of students to teachers.

**Step 1: Determine the number of boys at the school.**
Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of students at the school.**
We know there are 60 girls and 120 boys, so the total number of students is:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of teachers.**
The problem states that there are 5 students to every teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers is:
\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

\[
\text{Gerald's initial time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}

Next, we know that Gerald's improved diet has reduced his time by 10%. To find out how much time this reduction is, we calculate:

\[
\text{Reduction in time} = 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, Gerald's new time is:

\[
\text{Gerald's new time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds}

66,820,ar,"To determine the total number of people sent by all four schools, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of players per school:**
   - Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
   - Each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school has a total of \(5 + 5 = 10\) players.

2. **Calculate the number of coaches per school:**
   - Each school has one coach for each team.
   - There are 2 teams (girls' and boys'), so each school has \(2\) coaches.

3. **Calculate the total number of people per school:**
   - Each school has 10 players and 2 coaches.
   - Therefore, each school has a total of \(10 + 2 = 12\) people.

4. **Calculate the total number of people sent by all schools:**
   - There are 4 schools.
   - Each school has 12 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is \(4 \times 12 = 48\).

67,820,ar,"To determine the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

4. **Total number of gems:**
   - The total number of gems is the sum of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.
     \[
     175 + 140 + 280 = 595

Thus, the total number of gems in the chest is:

1. **Number of Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Number of Rubies:**
   - The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Number of Emeralds:**
   - The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280

4. **Total Number of Gems:**
   - To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

99,828,ar,"To determine how many potted plants Mary will remain with after giving some away, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.
2. Determine how many potted plants she will give away.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has:
- She received 18 new potted plants.
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.

Total number of potted plants = 18 new plants + 2 * 40 = 18 + 80 = 98

Next, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away 40 potted plants.

Now, we subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she currently has:
Number of potted plants remaining = 98 - 40 = 58

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess:
   \[

3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100

Now, we sum these guesses to find the total number of jelly beans:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240

Next, we divide the total by the number of friends to find the average:

53,844,ar,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for both days and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars
- Total revenue for Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \times 60 = 0\) dollars
- Total revenue for Friday: \(480 + 0 = 480\) dollars

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- Difference: \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars

Thus, the mechanic earned 40 dollars more on the day with higher revenue, which is Thursday. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40

1. **First Month:**
   The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number in the first month.
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   \[
   180 \times 0.70 = 126
   \]

Now, we sum the downloads from all three months:
\[
60 + 180 + 126
\]

Performing the addition:
\[
60 + 180 = 240
\]
\[
240 + 126 = 366

Next, calculate the total amount of water before spilling:

Subtract the spilled 1 liter of orange drink:

Next, let's determine her walking speed. We know that her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs and walks in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running, so she runs for \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours. The distance she runs is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.

She spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she walks for \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours. The distance she walks is \(1.5 \times 4 = 6\) miles.

Adding the distances she runs and walks gives us the total distance she travels in six hours. Therefore, the total distance is \(12 + 6 = 18\) miles.",18,0,

1. **First half of the year (6 months):**
   - The monthly charge for the first half is $140.
   - Total charge for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second half of the year (6 months):**
   - The monthly charge for the second half is 10% less than the first half.
   - 10% of $140 is $14.
   - Therefore, the monthly charge for the second half is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total charge for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total amount paid for the entire year:**
   - Total amount = Charge for the first half + Charge for the second half

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these two pieces of information as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the number of games lost is \( L = 7 \). To find the number of games won, we use the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games won is \( W = 15 \).",15,0,

1. **Calculate the volume of tomatoes needed before cooking:**

   \[
   \text{Volume of tomatoes needed} = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of cans needed:**
   Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes. To find the number of cans needed, we divide the total volume of tomatoes needed by the volume of one can.
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64}{16} = 4

3. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes:**
   Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is:

1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.
2. Subtract this total from the amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:

- Chicken meal: $12
- Milk: 5 packs at $3 per pack = $15
- Apples: 4 apples at $1.50 per apple = $6

Total cost = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Next, we subtract this total cost from the amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza:

$50 - $33 = $17

1. **Identify the cost of each pair of heels:**
   - One pair of heels costs $33.
   - The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair.
   - Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of heels:**
   - Total cost = cost of the first pair of heels + cost of the second pair of heels
   - Total cost = 33 + 66 = 99 dollars

3. **Determine the relationship between the total cost of the heels and the boots:**
   - The total cost of the heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots.
   - Therefore, the cost of the boots is the total cost of the heels plus five dollars.

4. **Calculate the cost of the boots:**
   - Cost of boots = Total cost of heels + 5

1. Identify the guesses of Gunter's friends.
2. Calculate the total of these guesses.
3. Divide the total by the number of friends to find the average.

Step 1: Identify the guesses of Gunter's friends.
- The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses \(\frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60\) jelly beans.
- The third friend guesses \(80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100\) jelly beans.

Step 2: Calculate the total of these guesses.
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

Step 3: Divide the total by the number of friends to find the average.
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar is \(80\).",80,0,

66,900,ar,"To determine the total number of people sent by all four schools, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of players in each school:
- Each school has 5 players on the girls' team.
- Each school has 5 players on the boys' team.
- Each school also has 1 coach for each team, so there are 2 coaches per school.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 5 + 5 + 2 = 12 \]
So, each school has 12 players.

Next, we need to find the total number of players in all four schools:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]
So, the total number of players in all four schools is 48.

Finally, to find the total number of people sent by all four schools, we need to consider the coaches in addition to the players. Each school has 2 coaches, so there are \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) coaches in total.

Therefore, the total number of people is:

3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess:

Now, we sum up all the guesses:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240

Next, we find the average by dividing the total sum by the number of friends:

Next, let's determine how much money John spends on video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each:

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. Therefore, the total amount of money he has after selling his lego sets is:

This means that John initially had 13 lego sets and sold them for a total of $195. After selling his lego sets, he has $40 left. Since he sells each lego set for $15, we can calculate how many lego sets he still has:

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each: \( 6 \times 60 = 360 \) dollars.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each: \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \) dollars.
- Total revenue for Thursday: \( 360 + 160 = 520 \) dollars.

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each: \( 12 \times 40 = 480 \) dollars.
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- Total revenue for Friday: \( 480 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the revenues for Thursday and Friday:
- Revenue on Thursday: $520
- Revenue on Friday: $480
- Difference: \( 520 - 480 = 40 \) dollars

1. Calculate the number of kittens Patchy has.
2. Calculate the number of kittens Trixie has.
3. Add the number of kittens adopted from the shelter to the kittens from Patchy and Trixie.

First, let's calculate the number of kittens Patchy has. Patchy has had three times the number of kittens adopted from the shelter. The number of kittens adopted from the shelter is 7.

\[
3 \times 7 = 21
\]

So, Patchy has 21 kittens.

Next, we know that Trixie has had 12 kittens. Therefore, Trixie has 12 kittens.

Now, we need to add the number of kittens adopted from the shelter to the kittens from Patchy and Trixie. The number of kittens adopted from the shelter is 7.

\[
7 + 21 + 12 = 40
\]

Thus, the Doubtfire family now has a total of 40 kittens.

1. **Calculate the 25% delivery fee:**
   - The original bill is $40.00.
   - The delivery fee is 25% of $40.00.
   - \( 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \).

2. **Add the delivery fee to the original bill:**
   - The original bill is $40.00.
   - The delivery fee is $10.00.
   - \( 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \).

3. **Add the tip to the total bill:**
   - The tip is $4.00.
   - \( 50.00 + 4.00 = 54.00 \).

Thus, the final price of Stephen's groceries is \(54.00\).",57,0,

First, calculate how much water each girl received:

First, let's find out how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a week. Since they produce 252 eggs per day and there are 7 days in a week, we calculate:

\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ 1764 \text{ eggs} \div 12 = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so:

\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$294  \]",294,0,

98,940,ar,"To determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to account for the number of cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cars on the motorway initially:**
   \[
   30
   \]

2. **Cars that took the exit:**
   \[
   5
   \]

3. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:**
   \[
   20
   \]

First, we need to subtract the cars that took the exit from the total number of cars on the motorway:
\[
30 - 5 = 25
\]

Next, we subtract the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the remaining cars:
\[
25 - 20 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:
\[
5
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5

37,948,ar,"John starts with 13 lego sets and sells each for $15, so he earns $13 \times 15 = 195$ dollars. He then spends $20 on each of 8 video games, which totals $8 \times 20 = 160$ dollars. This leaves him with $195 - 160 = 35$ dollars. If he has $5 left, he spent an additional $35 - 5 = 30$ dollars. Therefore, he spent a total of $160 + 30 = 190$ dollars. Since he only earned $195$ dollars, he must have spent an additional $5$ dollars on other items. Let's denote the number of additional lego sets he sold as $x$. Each additional lego set is sold for $15$. Therefore, $15x = 5$, so $x = \frac{5}{15} = 0.33$. Since he can't have a fraction of a lego set, he sold 0 additional lego sets. Thus, he still has $13 - 0 = \boxed{}$.",2,0,

1. Identify the number of diamonds.
2. Calculate the number of rubies.
3. Calculate the number of emeralds.
4. Add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems.

1. The number of diamonds is given as 175.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds:
   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140

3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies:
   \[
   \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280

4. The total number of gems is the sum of the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

1. **Initial Bill**: Stephen's final bill is $40.00.
2. **25% Delivery Fee**: The delivery vendor adds a 25% fee to the total bill.
   - Calculate 25% of $40.00: \( 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \)
   - Add this fee to the initial bill: \( 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \)
3. **Delivery Fees**: The delivery vendor charges $3.00 in delivery fees.
   - Add the delivery fees to the total so far: \( 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 \)
4. **Tip**: Stephen adds a $4.00 tip.
   - Add the tip to the total so far: \( 53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00 \)

2. The remaining 60% of the file is downloaded at a rate of 2 GB per minute.

First, calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:
\[ \text{Time for first 40\%} = \frac{40\% \text{ of } 200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, add the 20 minutes needed to restart the download:
\[ \text{Total download time} = \text{Time for first 40\%} + \text{Time to restart} \]
\[ \text{Total download time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes to download the file is:
\[ \boxed{60 \text{ minutes}} \]",160,0,

1. **Total number of oranges**: The basket contains 25 oranges.
2. **Bad oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.
3. **Unripe oranges**: Since 20% of the oranges are unripe, we calculate:
   \[
   0.20 \times 25 = 5 \text{ unripe oranges}
   \]
4. **Sour oranges**: There are 2 sour oranges.

Next, we add up the bad, unripe, and sour oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good:
\[
1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8 \text{ oranges}
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of non-good oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
\[
25 - 8 = 17
\]

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.",17,0,

52,988,ar,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removes. The weight of each comic book is \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. Subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight needed gives us the weight of the remaining items to be removed:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, we need to find out how many toys are required to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds. The number of toys required is:

\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.",15,0,

82,988,ar,"To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Alex's weight.
2. Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight to get their combined weight.

First, we know that Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Therefore, we calculate Alex's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 478 \]

Next, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight to find their combined weight:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 125 + 478 \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 603 \]

43,996,ar,"1. The total calorie target for the day is 2000 calories.
2. You have already consumed 1800 calories.
3. Therefore, you can consume an additional \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

4. Each serving of chips contains 250 calories.
5. To find out how many servings you can consume without exceeding the remaining calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
   \[
   \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings}
   \]

6. Since 1 serving is equal to 0.6 of the bag (because a 300g bag has 5 servings), 0.8 servings is:
   \[
   0.8 \times 0.6 = 0.48 \text{ of the bag}
   \]

7. Therefore, 0.48 of the bag is:
   \[
   0.48 \times 300 = 144 \text{ grams}

53,1004,ar,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for each day and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each.
- On Thursday, the mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each.

The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is:
\[ 6 \times 60 = 360 \]
The revenue from car tires on Thursday is:
\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

The total revenue on Thursday is:
\[ 360 + 160 = 520 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each.

The revenue from car tires on Friday is:
\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \]

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ 520 - 480 = 40 \]

88,1004,ar,"To solve the problem, let's define the variables first. Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald sold. According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so we can express the number of copies sold by Marilyn as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the following equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find the number of copies Harald sold, we need to isolate \( H \) on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

Performing the division, we get:
\[ H \approx 7,909.09 \]

Since the number of copies sold must be a whole number, we can conclude that \boxed{7909",8000,0,

1. **Determine Gerald's initial running time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's initial running time is:
     \[
     38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved running time:**
   - Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%.
   - To find the improved time, we calculate 10% of Gerald's initial time and add it to the initial time.
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ seconds} = 0.1 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we calculate:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:
\[
120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units}
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
\[

87,1020,ar,"Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month, so her annual salary is \(600 \times 12 = 7200\) dollars. The company increases her salary by 10% of her initial salary every year. Therefore, after the first year, her salary increases by \(0.10 \times 7200 = 7200 + 720 = 7920\) dollars.

After the second year, her salary increases by \(0.10 \times 7920 = 7920 + 792 = 8712\) dollars.

After the third year, her salary increases by \(0.10 \times 8712 = 8712 + 871.2 = 9583.2\) dollars.

After the fourth year, her salary increases by \(0.10 \times 9583.2 = 9583.2 + 958.32 = 10541.52\) dollars.
