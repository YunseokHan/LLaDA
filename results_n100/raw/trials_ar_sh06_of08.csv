11,6,ar,"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[ 3 \times 68 = 204 \]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Then, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[ 6 \times 55 = 330 \]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Finally, we sum up all the costs:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 
\]

- She walked 4 miles in the first hour.
- She walked 2 miles in the second hour.
- Total distance walked so far = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.

Next, let's determine the total time she has spent walking:
- She spent 1 hour for the first 4 miles.
- She spent 1 hour for the next 2 miles.
- Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance and the remaining time:
- Total distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.
- Total time = 2 hours - 2 hours = 0 hours (This means no time is left, but we need to find the speed for the remaining distance).

We need to find the speed for the remaining 6 miles to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
- Speed for remaining distance = 4 miles per hour / Total time = 4 miles per hour / 2 hours = 2 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we know that the cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties to the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

1. Determine the number of jelly beans each friend thinks are in the jar.
2. Sum the guesses of all three friends.
3. Divide the total by the number of friends to get the average.

Let's start with the guesses:

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.
3. The third friend says \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now, we sum these guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Next, we divide the total by the number of friends to find the average:
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

Therefore, the average guess of the number of jelly beans is \(80\).",80,0,

2. Calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday.
3. Calculate the total number of hours spent on each day.
4. Sum up the total hours spent over the three days.

1. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 7 + 1.26 = 8.26\) articles.
2. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which means she wrote \(2 \times 8.26 = 16.52\) articles.
3. Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total hours spent on each day is the number of articles written multiplied by 4.

1. Calculate the total number of hours from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
2. Multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting per hour.

First, let's count the hours:
- From 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM is 1 hour.
- From 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM is 1 hour.
- From 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is 1 hour.
- From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 1 hour.

So, the total number of hours is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\) hours.

Next, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting per hour:
- The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.

Therefore, the total reduction in candle height is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) centimeters.

Next, we calculate the number of girls. Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:

Now, we find out how many girls are in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80

Finally, we determine the number of girls who are not in the girl scout. We do this by subtracting the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[
\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40

93,30,ar,"To determine how fast Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles after his improved diet, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate the improvement in Gerald's speed:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%.
   - To find the improvement in time, we calculate 10% of Gerald's original time.
   - 10% of 40 seconds is \( 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \) seconds.

3. **Determine Gerald's new time:**
   - Subtract the improvement in time from Gerald's original time.
   - Gerald's new time is \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) seconds.

Thus, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.",36,0,

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, we calculate the total number of units in the building:
\[
15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units}
\]

Next, we determine the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we calculate:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ occupied units}
\]

Finally, we find the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[
120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ occupied units} = 30 \text{ unoccupied units}
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the comic books.
The weight of one comic book is \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books.
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 2: Subtract the total weight of the comic books from the total weight to be removed to find the remaining weight.
\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 3: Use the remaining weight to determine how many toys need to be removed.
The weight of one toy is \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound.

1. Calculate the number of pets Marcia has.
2. Calculate the number of pets Jan has.
3. Add the number of pets for each person to find the total number of pets.

First, we know that Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy:
\[ \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = \text{Number of pets Cindy has} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Next, Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia:
\[ \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we add the number of pets for each person to find the total number of pets:
\[ \text{Number of pets Cindy has} + \text{Number of pets Marcia has} + \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

Next, we want her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. Since average speed equals total distance divided by total time, we set up the equation:

\[ 4 = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{2} \]

Solving for the total distance:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Marissa has already walked 4 miles and 2 miles, so she has 8 - 4 - 2 = 2 miles left to walk. She has 2 hours remaining to walk these 2 miles. We can now find the speed she needs for the remaining distance by dividing the remaining distance by the remaining time:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know the number of dogs is 60.
   - There are two cats for every dog.
   - Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - The number of cats is 120.
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of dogs, cats, and rabbits.
   - Total = 60 + 120 + 168 = \(348\).",348,0,

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.

\[
\text{Total number of units} = 15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Next, we calculate the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4.

\[
\text{Number of occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

\[
\text{Number of unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30

1. Calculate the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give to her chickens each day.
2. Subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount needed.

First, calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock each day:
\[
20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups per chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[
15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount needed:
\[
60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings.
   - Total calories in the bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

2. Calculate the remaining daily calorie target:
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:
   - Each serving has 250 calories, so the number of servings you can eat with 200 calories is:
     200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.
   - Since the bag has 5 servings, the number of grams you can eat is:
     0.8 servings * 300g / 5 servings = 48 grams.

1. **Number of dogs**: Given as 60.
2. **Number of cats**: Since there are two cats for every dog, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]
3. **Number of rabbits**: The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180

   Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168

2,86,ar,"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the original purchase price from the increased value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the increased value of the house. The repairs increased the value by 150%.

\[
\text{Increased value} = 80,000 + (1.5 \times 80,000)
\]

\[
\text{Increased value} = 80,000 + 120,000
\]

\[
\text{Increased value} = 200,000
\]

Next, we find the profit by subtracting the original purchase price from the increased value.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Increased value} - \text{Original purchase price}
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = 200,000 - 80,000
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = 120,000
\]

19,94,ar,"First, we need to determine the total time Marissa has spent hiking so far.

- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
- Therefore, the total time spent is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Next, we need to determine the total distance she has walked so far:
- She walked 4 miles in the first hour.
- She walked 2 miles in the next hour.
- Therefore, the total distance walked is \(4 + 2 = 6\) miles.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, so the remaining distance is \(12 - 6 = 6\) miles.

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire trail, Marissa needs to hike the remaining 6 miles in \(4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 2\) hours.

Thus, she needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of \(\frac{6 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = \boxed{3 \text{ miles per hour}}\).",6,0,

1. Calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week.
2. Divide the total distance he runs in a week by the total number of hours he runs in a week.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week.
- On the first day, John runs for 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs for half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- On the third day, he runs for half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- Therefore, the total number of hours he runs in a week is \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours.

Step 2: Divide the total distance he runs in a week by the total number of hours he runs in a week.
- John runs 60 miles a week.

1. **Calculate the total number of servings needed for 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving per day.
   - Therefore, for 60 days, she will need:
     \[
     1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of cartons needed:**
   - Each carton contains 15 servings.
   - To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - The total cost for 4 cartons is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4/\text{ carton } = \$16

51,110,ar,"First, let's calculate the distance Tom travels while sailing from 1 PM to 4 PM.

The formula for distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the outbound journey:
- Speed = 10 miles per hour
- Time = 3 hours (1 PM to 4 PM)

So, the distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

The formula for time is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the return journey:
- Distance = 30 miles
- Speed = 6 miles per hour

So, the time is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

74,110,ar,"To determine how much Artie will make, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of flower and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the revenue from marigolds:
   - Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds at $2.74 per pot.
   - Revenue from marigolds = 12 * $2.74 = $32.98

2. Calculate the revenue from petunias:
   - Artie sells 9 pots of petunias at $1.87 per pot.
   - Revenue from petunias = 9 * $1.87 = $16.83

3. Calculate the revenue from begonias:
   - Artie sells 17 pots of begonias at $2.12 per pot.
   - Revenue from begonias = 17 * $2.12 = $36.04

4. Sum the revenues from all types of flowers:
   - Total revenue = $32.98 + $16.83 + $36.04 = $86

53,118,ar,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for each day and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each: \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each: \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars
- Total revenue for Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each: \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars
- No truck tires are repaired, so the revenue from truck tires is $0$ dollars
- Total revenue for Friday: \(480 + 0 = 480\) dollars

Now, let's find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- Difference in revenue: \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars

1. **Initial number of cars:**
   There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars taking an exit:**
   5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars left in the traffic jam is:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Cars driving through in the remaining 15 minutes:**
   20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

4. **Total number of cars that drove through:**
   The total number of cars that drove through in the traffic jam is:
   \[
   25 - 20 = 5
   \]

5. **Cars driving through in the first 15 minutes:**
   Since 5 cars took an exit and 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:

1. **Calculate the amount of water each girl received:**
   - Each girl received \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water.
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]
   Therefore, each girl received 4 liters of water.

2. **Calculate the total amount of water given to the girls:**
   - There are two girls, and each received 4 liters of water.
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]
   Therefore, the total amount of water given to the girls is 8 liters.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water given:**
   - The boy received 6 liters of water.
   \[
   8 + 6 = 14 \text{ liters}

Wendi's chicken flock consists of 20 chickens, and each chicken receives 3 cups of feed. Therefore, the total amount of feed needed for all the chickens in one day is:
\[
20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we know how much feed Wendi has already given the chickens. In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. Therefore, the total amount of feed she has given so far is:
\[
15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

The remaining amount of feed that Wendi needs to give in the final meal of the day is:
\[
60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = \boxed{20 \text{ cups}}

The total number of coins Gretchen has is given as 110. This can be expressed as:
\[ S + G = 110 \]

Substitute the value of \( G \) from the previous equation into this equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 40 \) back into the expression for \( G \):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Thus, Gretchen has 70 \boxed gold coins.",70,0,

2,174,ar,"Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs, which increased its value by 150%. First, let's calculate the increase in value due to the repairs.

The increase is:
\[ 150\% \times 50,000 = 1.5 \times 50,000 = 75,000 \]

So, the new value of the house after the repairs is:
\[ 50,000 + 75,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, Josh sold the house for $125,000. He also paid $50,000 for the repairs, which was a capital expenditure. The initial purchase price was $80,000, so his total cost was:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, the profit made is:
\[ 125,000 - 130,000 \]",70000,0,

11,174,ar,"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- The cost per dozen is $68.
- Total cost for donuts = \(3 \times 68 = 204\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- The cost per dozen is $80.
- Total cost for mini cupcakes = \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

Then, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- The cost per dozen is $55.
- Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \(6 \times 55 = 330\).

Now, we sum up the total costs of all the pastries:
- Total cost = \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\).

1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.
2. Subtract the total cost of these items from the amount Marie paid to find out how much she spent on pizza.
3. Divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box of pizza to find the number of boxes ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the chicken meal.
\[ 12 \]

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the milk.
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the apples.
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Step 4: Add the costs together:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \]

Step 5: Subtract this total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

Step 6: Determine the number of boxes of pizza ordered:
\[ 17 \div 8.50 = 2 \]",2,0,
26,174,ar,"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost for each type of clothing and then sum these amounts.

First, calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair costs $16.50.
- Total cost for shorts = \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\).

Next, calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair costs $22.50.
- Total cost for pants = \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\).

Finally, calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair costs $42.
- Total cost for shoes = \(3 \times 42 = 126\).

Now, sum the costs for all the clothing items:
- Total cost = \(49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243\).

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 180 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 360 \text{ cups} \]

Now, let's add the two amounts together to find the total amount consumed:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, we divide the total amount of dog food by the amount in one bag:
\[ 540 \text{ cups} \div 110 \text{ cups/bag} = \boxed{5 \text{ bags}} \]",5,0,

- Westward Journey

- Both trains travel 80 miles westward.
- Therefore, the distance covered by each train westward is:
  \[
  \text{Distance westward} = 80 \text{ miles}
  \]

- Northward Journey

- Both trains travel 150 miles northward.
- Therefore, the distance covered by each train northward is:
  \[
  \text{Distance northward} = 150 \text{ miles}
  \]

### Total Distance Covered by Each Train

- To find the total distance covered by each train, we add the westward and northward distances:
  \[
  \text{Total distance} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
  \]

Thus, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:

1. **Bad oranges:**
   - There is 1 bad orange.

2. **Unripe oranges:**
   - 20% of the oranges are unripe.
   - Calculate 20% of 25: \( 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \).

3. **Sour oranges:**
   - There are 2 sour oranges.

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges that are either bad, unripe, or sour:

- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 5
- Sour oranges: 2

Total bad, unripe, and sour oranges:
\[ 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 \]

Finally, we find the number of good oranges by subtracting the total number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:

Total oranges: 25
Good oranges: 25 - 8 = 17

So, the number of good oranges is \(17\).",17,0,

First, let's determine the total time Jim spends on TV and reading each week:

30,214,ar,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Given the ratio of their ages is 7:11, we can express Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\). The total age now is 162, so we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into his age expression:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's current age is 99. To find his age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109.",109,0,

1. Determine the number of jelly beans each friend thinks are in the jar.
2. Add up all the guesses.
3. Divide the total by the number of friends to get the average.

First, let's determine each friend's guess:
- The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess:
  \[
  \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 60
  \]
- The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess:
  \[
  80 \times 1.25 = 100
  \]

Next, we add up all the guesses:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

Finally, we divide the total by the number of friends:
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is:
\[

61,214,ar,"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to break down the costs and sum them up step by step.

1. **Cost of materials:**
   Janet pays $500 for the materials.

2. **Cost of construction:**
   Janet pays $800 for the construction.

3. **Insurance cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost for insurance. First, we need to find the total cost before insurance, which is the sum of the material and construction costs:
   \[
   500 + 800 = 1300
   \]
   Now, we calculate 10% of this total cost:
   \[
   0.10 \times 1300 = 130
   \]
   Therefore, she pays $130 for insurance.

4. **Total cost:**
   Finally, we sum up all the costs to find the total amount paid:
   \[
   500 + 800 + 130 = 1430

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries:

12,238,ar,"To determine how many years it will take Carlos before he starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to compare the initial cost of planting the tree to the annual earnings from selling lemons minus the annual cost of maintaining the tree.

First, let's calculate the annual earnings from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons.
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual earnings are \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, we need to subtract the annual cost of maintaining the tree from the annual earnings:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.
- Therefore, the net earnings per year are \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net earnings to equal or exceed the initial cost of planting the tree:
- The initial cost is $90.
- The net earnings per year are $7.5.
- Therefore, the number of years required is \(\frac{90}{7.5} = 12\).

50,238,ar,"Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. To find out how many eggs are produced in a week, we multiply the daily production by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs are produced in a week. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs/week}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. Therefore, we calculate the total revenue from selling 147 dozens of eggs:

\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Thus, the amount Lloyd makes on eggs per week is:

61,246,ar,"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to break down the costs and sum them up step by step.

1. **Cost of the material:**
   Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch.

2. **Cost for the jeweler to construct the brooch:**
   Janet pays $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Insurance cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost to get the brooch insured. First, we need to find the total cost before insurance.

   Total cost = Cost of the material + Cost for the jeweler to construct the brooch
   Total cost = $500 + $800 = $1300

   Insurance cost = 10% of Total cost
   Insurance cost = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

4. **Total cost:**
   Total cost = Total cost + Insurance cost
   Total cost = $1300 + $130 = $1430

1. Identify the distance Henry traveled from the start of his trip to his first stop.
2. Identify the distance from his second stop to the end of his trip.
3. Calculate the distance between his first and second stops.

First, let's find the distance Henry traveled from the start of his trip to his first stop:
- The total distance of his trip is 60 miles.
- His first stop was after 20 miles.
- Therefore, he traveled \(60 - 20 = 40\) miles.

Next, let's find the distance from his second stop to the end of his trip:
- His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.
- Therefore, he traveled \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, we calculate the distance between his first and second stops:
- The distance between his first and second stops is \(40 - 20 = 20\) miles.

Thus, Henry traveled \(20\) miles between his first and second stops.",25,0,

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept. 

So, let's calculate James's sleep:
\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

Now, calculate that:
\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, James slept 6 hours. Now, subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 \]

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   Given that the number of dogs is 60.

2. **Calculate the number of cats:**
   According to the problem, there are two cats for every dog.
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of dogs}) - 12 = (120 + 60) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   Add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

1. **Initial number of cars on the motorway:**
   There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that took an exit:**
   5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

3. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:**
   20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

4. **Total cars that drove through the traffic jam:**
   The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.

2. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \). Therefore, the second friend says \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.

3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \). Therefore, the third friend says \( 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now, we sum the guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Now, we know she has already spent 2 hours, so the remaining time is \(3 - 2 = 1\) hour.

The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance she has already walked: \(12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 6 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we know that her running speed is four times faster than her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Now, we need to determine how many hours she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Therefore, she spends \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours running and \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours walking.

The total distance she runs is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles, and the total distance she walks is \(1.5 \times 4 = 6\) miles. Adding these distances together gives the total distance she travels in six hours: \(12 + 6 = 18\) miles.

1. **Cost of the first glass**: The first glass costs $5.
2. **Cost of the second glass**: The second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass. Therefore, the cost of the second glass is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
3. **Cost of the third glass**: The third glass costs 60% of the price of the second glass. Therefore, the cost of the third glass is \(0.60 \times 3 = 1.8\) dollars.
4. **Generalize the pattern**: The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass.

To find the cost of the 16th glass, we notice that every second glass is cheaper. Specifically, the 16th glass is the same as the first glass because it is an odd-numbered position.

Thus, the cost of the 16th glass is:

1. The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days.
   \[
   1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the remaining 180 days.
   \[
   2 \text{ cups/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 360 \text{ cups}
   \]

Adding these two amounts together:
\[
180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups}
\]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups:
\[
\frac{540 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}
\]

So, Cecilia will use 4 bags of dog food in the first year.",5,0,

1. **Initial Salary Calculation**:
   The company pays each employee $600 per month. Therefore, in a year (12 months), the salary is:
   \[
   600 \times 12 = 7200
   \]

2. **Annual Salary Increase**:
   The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year. The initial salary is $7200, so the annual increase is:
   \[
   0.10 \times 7200 = 7200 + 720 = 7920
   \]

3. **Total Years of Service**:
   Sylvie has already been in the company for 5 years. After three more years of service, she will have been in the company for a total of:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day:
   - Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Wendi's flock consists of 20 chickens.
   - Total feed needed = 3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed given so far:
   - In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed.
   - In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.
   - Total feed given so far = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

3. Determine how much feed is needed for the final meal:
   - Total feed needed = 60 cups.
   - Feed given so far = 40 cups.
   - Feed needed for the final meal = 20 cups.

1. **Points scored in the first 20 minutes:**
   Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

2. **Points scored in the second 20 minutes:**
   Mike scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find this, we calculate 25% of 4 and add it to 4.
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1

   So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:

Next, calculate the number of red ties John bought.

Now, determine the cost per red tie, which is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie.

Finally, calculate the total cost of all the ties.

1. Calculate the total weight of the comic books.
2. Subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove.
3. Divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy to find the number of toys needed.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and Uriah removes 30 comic books:

\[
30 \times \frac{0.25}{1} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}

Finally, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy, which weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound:

3. Each school has 2 teams: 1 girls' team and 1 boys' team.

First, let's calculate the total number of people sent by one school:

According to the problem, Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so her running speed is \( 4v \) miles per hour. We are also given that she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, so her skipping speed is \( 3 \) miles per hour.

To find Dana's walking speed, we solve the equation:
\[ v = 1 \]
Thus, Dana's walking speed is 1 mile per hour, and her running speed is 4 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If she spends six hours in total, then she spends:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours running} \]

53,310,ar,"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 per tire:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360
  \]
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 per tire:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160
  \]
- The total revenue for Thursday is:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 per tire:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480
  \]
- The total revenue for Friday is:
  \[
  480
  \]

To find the difference in revenue between the two days, we subtract the revenue from the lower revenue day (Friday) from the revenue from the higher revenue day (Thursday):
  \[
  520 - 480 = 40
  \]

1. **First segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 3 hours × 60 mph = 180 miles.

2. **Second segment:**
   - John spends the next half-hour driving at 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

3. **Third segment:**
   - John drives the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.
   - Time = 4 hours - 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 0.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 0.5 hours = 40 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances to find the total distance from home at the end of the 4 hours:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} = 195 \text{ miles} \]

\[ 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB} \]
\[ \text{Time to download 80 GB} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

\[ 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \text{ GB} \]
\[ \text{Time to download 120 GB} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

We also need to include the time spent for the restart, which takes 20 minutes.

Now, we sum up all these times to get the total download time.

68,334,ar,"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school.
2. Calculate the total number of students at the school.
3. Determine the number of teachers based on the given ratio of students to teachers.

First, we know that there are twice as many boys as girls. Given that there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

We are given that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the ratio of students to teachers:
\[
\text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36
\]

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is:
\[

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know there are two cats for every dog.
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - The number of cats is 120.
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - The number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the combined number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

1. **Cost of Shorts:**
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs.
   - Total cost for shorts = \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\).

2. **Cost of Pants:**
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs.
   - Total cost for pants = \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\).

3. **Cost of Shoes:**
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs.
   - Total cost for shoes = \(3 \times 42 = 126\).

Now, we sum the costs of all the items:

2. Next, we need to find out how far she could throw the javelin when holding the gemstone. The problem states that with the gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than without it.
   \[
   \text{Throw distance with gemstone} = 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the javelin, we subtract the range of the dragon's flames from the throw distance with the gemstone.
   \[
   \text{Additional distance} = 1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, Polly could stand \(200\) feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames if she holds the sapphire gemstone.",200,0,

\[ 5 \times 250 = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we know that the total daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the calories you can still consume are:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Since a serving is 250 calories, the number of servings you can still eat is:

\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Given that each serving is 5 servings in a 300g bag, the weight of 0.8 servings is:

\[ \frac{0.8}{5} \times 300 = 48 \text{ grams} \]

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   - Number of downloads in the second month = 3 * 60 = 180.

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the third month reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - Number of downloads in the third month = 180 - (30% of 180) = 180 - (0.3 * 180) = 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we sum the number of downloads over the three months:

- Total number of downloads = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is \(366\).",366,0,

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - Each article takes 4 hours.
   - Total hours on Monday = \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\).
   - Total hours on Tuesday = \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles as on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = \(2 \times 7 = 14\).
   - Total hours on Wednesday = \(14 \times 4 = 56\) hours.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each: \(6 \times 60 = 360\)
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each: \(4 \times 40 = 160\)
- Therefore, the total revenue for Thursday is: \(360 + 160 = 520\)

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each: \(12 \times 40 = 480\)
- Therefore, the total revenue for Friday is: \(480\)

Now, we compare the revenues:
- Revenue on Thursday: $520
- Revenue on Friday: $480

The difference in revenue is: \(520 - 480 = 40\)

Thus, the final result is:

1. **Calculate James's sleep duration:**
   - James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept.
   - Harry slept 9 hours.
   - Therefore, James's sleep duration is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9\) hours.
   - To find \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9\), we can simplify it as follows:
     \[
     \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the difference in sleep duration:**
   - Harry slept for 9 hours.
   - James slept for 6 hours.
   - The difference in sleep duration is the difference between 9 hours and 6 hours:
     \[
     9 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, Harry slept 3 more hours than James last night.",3,0,

52,374,ar,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, we multiply the weight of one comic book by the number of comic books:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 30 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Therefore, the weight he still needs to remove is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:

\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final answer is:

1. Calculate the amount of water each girl received.
2. Subtract the amount of water each girl received from the total amount of water to find the amount left after the girls have received their share.
3. Subtract the amount of water the boy received from the remaining water.

First, let's find out how much water each girl received. Each girl received \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water.
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]
Since there are two girls, they together received:
\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we subtract the total amount of water the girls received from the original total:
\[
24 - 8 = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Finally, we subtract the 6 liters the boy received:
\[
16 - 6 = 10 \text{ liters}

\[
60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, calculate the distance he drives in the second half-hour:
\[
30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}
\]

Then, calculate the distance he drives in the last 1 hour:
\[
80 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 80 \text{ miles}
\]

Add the distances together to find the total distance he has driven:
\[
180 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 80 \text{ miles} = 275 \text{ miles}
\]

Since he turns around and goes back home, the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours is the same as the distance he has driven, which is 275 miles.

\[
\boxed{275 \text{ miles}}

1. Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

1. The cost of supplies for one pound of beeswax is $10.00. Since Charlie makes 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit:
   \[
   \text{Net profit} = 200 - 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}

Next, we know that her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much distance she travels in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:

   - Therefore, each school has \(2 \times 1 = 2\) coaches.

3. **Calculate the total number of people per school:**
   - Each school has 10 players.
   - Each school has 2 coaches.
   - Therefore, each school has \(10 + 2 = 12\) people.

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we find the number of girls. Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

Now, we calculate the number of girls who are in the girl scout. Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we have:

\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Finally, we find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout by subtracting the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[
\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40

First month:
The program had 60 downloads.

Second month:
The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as in the first month.
\[
3 \times 60 = 180
\]
So, the program had 180 downloads in the second month.

Third month:
The number of downloads in the third month reduced by 30% from the second month.
\[
0.30 \times 180 = 54
\]
So, the program had 54 downloads in the third month.

Now, we sum the number of downloads from all three months:
\[
60 + 180 + 54
\]

Calculating the total:
\[
60 + 180 = 240
\]
\[
240 + 54 = 294
\]

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is:

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \)

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \)

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \)

1. **Time spent on TV per day:**
   Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.

2. **Time spent reading per day:**
   Jim reads for half as long as he does watching TV. Therefore, he reads for \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

3. **Total time spent on TV and reading per day:**
   Total time per day = Time spent on TV + Time spent reading
   Total time per day = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

4. **Total time spent on TV and reading per week:**
   Total time per week = Total time per day * 3 days
   Total time per week = 3 hours * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week

5. **Total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks:**
   Total time in 4 weeks = Total time per week * 4 weeks
   Total time in 4 weeks = 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.

First, let's find out how much laundry David does:
\[ \text{DDavid's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, let's find out how much laundry Raymond does:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{DDavid's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

1. **Number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Number of cats:**
   The number of cats is twice the number of dogs. Therefore:
   \[

3. **Number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. First, we find the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 188

4. **Total number of pets:**
   The number of pets is twelve less than the combined number:

\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of one red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of one red tie is:

\[
40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The total cost for the red ties is:

\[
10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
200 + 600 = 800

2. Determine the number of Post-it notes she had remaining after using some.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had remaining from the total number of Post-it notes she initially had to find out how many she purchased.

First, let's calculate the total number of Post-it notes she used at work. She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. So, she used 220 Post-it notes.

Next, we know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she initially had is the sum of the Post-it notes she used and the Post-it notes she had remaining:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Since she initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse, the number of Post-it notes she purchased is:

1. **Sarah's Laundry:** Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. **David's Laundry:** Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we calculate David's laundry as follows:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. **Raymond's Laundry:** Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we calculate Raymond's laundry as follows:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:
\[
\text{Difference} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 60 mph × 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Next, we need to calculate the distance John has driven in the second part of the trip.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 80 mph × 2 hours
Distance = 160 miles

Now, we need to calculate the distance John has driven in the third part of the trip.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

Finally, we need to calculate the total distance John has traveled.

Total distance = Distance + Distance + Distance
Total distance = 180 miles + 160 miles + 15 miles
Total distance = 355 miles

However, since John turned around after 3 hours and then returned home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled towards home (180 miles).

1. **First Month:**
   The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number in the first month.
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ downloads}

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   First, calculate 30% of 180:
   \[
   0.30 \times 180 = 54 \text{ downloads}
   \]
   Subtract this from the second month's downloads:
   \[

1. Calculate the cost of the chicken meal.
2. Calculate the total cost of the packs of milk.
3. Calculate the total cost of the apples.
4. Subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, packs of milk, and apples from the total amount paid.
5. Divide the remaining amount by the cost per box of pizza to find the number of boxes.

Let's go through each step:

1. The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.
4. The total cost of the chicken meal, packs of milk, and apples is \(12 + 15 + 6 = 33\) dollars.
5. The remaining amount for the pizza is \(50 - 33 = 17\) dollars.
6. Therefore, Marie ordered \(\frac{17}{8.50}\) boxes of pizza",2,0,

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the ties:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 40 + 10 \times 60 = 200 + 600 = 800

1. **Determine how many sheep Charleston has:**
   - We know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

2. **Determine how many sheep Toulouse has:**
   - We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Charleston has 80 sheep.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

3. **Calculate the total number of sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Charleston has 80 sheep.
   - Toulouse has 160 sheep.
   - Adding these together, we get \(20 + 80 + 160 = 260\) sheep.

Thus, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is \(260\).",260,0,

2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 2 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{6} - 1 \text{ vacuum cleaners}

We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:

Solving for \( x \):

1. **Number of Dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Number of Cats:**
   There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. First, we find the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   The number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

4. **Total Number of Pets:**
   The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[

**Step 1: Calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes.**
Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

**Step 2: Calculate the points scored in the second 20 minutes.**
Mike scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, he scores an additional 1 point in the second 20 minutes, making his total score for the second 20 minutes:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total points scored.**
Add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes:

Given:
- John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties.
- He spent $200 on blue ties at $40 each.
- The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie.

Let's calculate the cost of each red tie:
\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = \frac{50}{100} \times 40 = 20 \]

Now, calculate the number of blue ties John bought:
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Next, since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties:
\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, calculate the total amount spent on ties:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 5 \times 40 + 10 \times 20 = 200 + 200 = 400 \]

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is:
     \[
     38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald's diet change improves his speed by 10%.
   - To find the improved time, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds and subtract it from 40 seconds.
   - 10% of 40 seconds is:
     \[
     0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Subtracting 4 seconds from 40 seconds gives:

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour to teach.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from teaching are \(35 \times 20 = 700\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour to be a coach.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from coaching are \(15 \times 30 = 450\) dollars.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings from teaching + Weekly earnings from coaching
- Total weekly earnings = $700 + $450 = $1150

Finally, let's calculate her annual salary:
- Annual salary = Total weekly earnings \(\times\) Number of weeks per year
- Annual salary = $1150 \times 50 = $57,500",57500,0,

\[
\text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so:

\[
\text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, we have 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the remaining orange drink is:

\[
\text{Water in remaining orange drink} = 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters}
\]

Adding this to the water from the pineapple drink, we get:

\[
\text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - There are twice the number of emeralds than rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

Now, we sum up the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems:

\[
175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595

10,510,ar,"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of downloads in the first month is 60.

Next, we calculate the number of downloads in the second month, which is three times the number of downloads in the first month:
\[
\text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
\]

Then, we calculate the number of downloads in the third month, which is reduced by 30% compared to the second month. To find the reduced number, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180:
\[
\text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - 0.3 \times 180 = 180 - 54 = 126
\]

Now, we sum up the downloads for all three months to find the total:
\[
\text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
\]

67,518,ar,"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - There are twice the number of emeralds than rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

4. **Total number of gems:**
   - To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
     \[
     175 + 140 + 280 = 595
     \]

Thus, the total number of gems in the chest is:

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 180 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 360 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total consumption:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, we determine how many bags of dog food are needed by dividing the total consumption by the amount in one bag:

93,518,ar,"First, let's determine Gerald's initial time for the 400-meter hurdles. We know that Lee runs the hurdles in 38 seconds, which is two seconds faster than Gerald's initial time.

Let \( G \) be Gerald's initial time in seconds. According to the problem,

\[ G + 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \),

\[ G = 38 - 2 = 36 \]

So, Gerald's initial time was 36 seconds.

Next, we need to find out how much faster Gerald runs with his improved diet. Since Gerald's speed improved by 10%, we calculate 10% of his initial time and subtract it from his initial time.

10% of Gerald's initial time is:

\[ 0.10 \times 36 = 3.6 \]

Subtracting this from his initial time,

\[ 36 - 3.6 = 32.4 \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in:

39,534,ar,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the distance she covers based on the time she spends running and walking.

Let \( r \) be Dana's running speed in miles per hour. According to the problem, she can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

Let \( w \) be Dana's walking speed in miles per hour. According to the problem, she runs at a speed four times faster than she walks. Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

The distance she runs is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) miles. The distance she walks is \( 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \) miles.

53,550,ar,"First, calculate the earnings for Thursday:
- On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 per tire:
- Earnings from truck tires = 6 * $60 = $360.
- On Thursday, the mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 per tire:
- Earnings from car tires = 4 * $40 = $160.
- Total earnings for Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520.

Next, calculate the earnings for Friday:
- On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 per tire:
- Earnings from car tires = 12 * $40 = $480.
- Since there were no truck tires repaired on Friday, earnings from truck tires = $0.
- Total earnings for Friday = $480 + $0 = $480.

Finally, determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue.
- Revenue difference = Thursday's total earnings - Friday's total earnings
Revenue difference = $520 - $480 = $40

First, let's calculate the charges for the first half of the year:
- The monthly charge is $140.
- There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
- Total charges for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the charges for the second half of the year:
- The monthly charge is reduced by 10%, so it becomes \( 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \) dollars per month.
- There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
- Total charges for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total charges for both halves to find the total amount paid by the end of the year:
- Total charges: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.",1596,0,

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per day.
2. Determine the number of eggs produced per week.
3. Convert the number of eggs to dozens.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

Next, we calculate the number of eggs produced per week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Now, we convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$294 \]",294,0,

25,566,ar,"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples, and then subtract this from the total amount paid to find the cost of the pizzas. Finally, we will divide the cost of the pizzas by the cost per box to find the number of boxes.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.
- Chicken meal: $12
- Milk: $3 per pack, 5 packs = $15
- Apples: $1.50 per apple, 4 apples = $6

Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 2: Subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid to find the cost of the pizzas.
Cost of pizzas: $50 - $33 = $17

Step 3: Divide the cost of the pizzas by the cost per box to find the number of boxes.
Number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 per box = 2

1. **Calculate the number of downloads in the second month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads in the first month.
   - In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of downloads in the third month:**
   - In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - To find the number of downloads, we calculate 70% of the second month's downloads.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 \times 0.70 = 126
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of downloads over the three months:**
   \[

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the number of eggs into dozens.
3. Compute the revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week.
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

**Step 2: Convert the number of eggs into dozens.**

There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

**Step 3: Compute the revenue from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells each dozen for $2.
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$294/\text{week} \]

1. **First 20 Minutes:**
   Mike scores 4 points.

2. **Second 20 Minutes:**
   Mike scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.
   - 25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.
   - Adding this to the original 4 points, Mike scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points in the second 20 minutes.

3. **Total Points:**

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much more weight Uriah needs to remove to reach his goal of 15 pounds. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds from the comic books, the remaining weight is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many toys he needs to remove to remove 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound, we can find the number of toys by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 15
\]

Therefore, the number of toys Uriah needs to remove is:

35,590,ar,"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes. We know that he scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than in the first 20 minutes.

The points scored in the first 20 minutes are 4 points. To find 25% of 4 points, we calculate:
\[
25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
\]

Adding this to the points scored in the first 20 minutes gives us the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
\[
4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
\]

Now, we sum the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes:
\[
4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points}
\]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

First, we know the number of dogs is 60. According to the problem, there are 2 cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
\[
\text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120

Next, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
\[

\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 88 \]

Finally, we sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total number of pets:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = \boxed{268",348,0,

   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{400}{5} = 80
   \]

2. Next, find the number of girls in Grade 5.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 200 - \text{Number of boys} = 200 - 80 = 120
   \]

3. Then, find the number of girls in the girl scout.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = \frac{240}{3} = 80
   \]

4. Finally, find the number of girls not in the girl scout.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40

47,614,ar,"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties and each blue tie costs $40, we can calculate the number of blue ties by dividing the total cost by the cost per blue tie:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of all the ties:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 40 + 10 \times 60 = 200 + 600 = \boxed{800",800,0,

1. Calculate each friend's guess.
2. Sum all the guesses.
3. Divide the sum by the number of friends to get the average.

Let's start with the first step:
- The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess:
  \[
  \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
  \]
- The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess:
  \[
  80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
  \]

Next, we sum these guesses:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

Finally, we divide the sum by the number of friends (which is 3) to get the average:
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80

93,630,ar,"To determine Gerald's new running time, we start by understanding the given information:

1. Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
3. Gerald's speed improved by 10% after changing his diet.

First, calculate Gerald's original running time:
\[
\text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, determine the improvement in Gerald's running time:
\[
\text{Improvement} = 10\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ seconds} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}
\]

Finally, calculate Gerald's new running time:
\[
\text{Gerald's new time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds",36,0,

1. **Number of Dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Number of Cats:**
   The number of cats is two times the number of dogs.
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168

4. **Total Number of Pets:**
   Add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together.
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

93,638,ar,"1. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald.

Let's denote:
- \( G \) as Gerald's original time in seconds

The relationship between Lee's time and Gerald's time is given by:
\[ G - 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald's original time for running the 400-meter hurdles is 40 seconds.

3. Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.
4. A 10% improvement means running the race in 90% of his original time.

Calculate Gerald's new time:
\[ G_{\text{new}} = 40 \times 0.90 \]
\[ G_{\text{new}} = 36 \]

Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.",36,0,

1. **Initial number of cars on the motorway:**
   There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that took an exit:**
   5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
   Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25

3. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:**
   20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

4. **Calculate the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes:**
   The total number of cars that drove through is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes.
   Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

11,662,ar,"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = \boxed{79",694,0,

76,670,ar,"First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 180 days:
\[
1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the remaining days:
\[
360 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 720 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, let's add the two amounts to find the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year:
\[
180 \text{ cups} + 720 \text{ cups} = 900 \text{ cups}
\]

Finally, let's determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use. Since one bag contains 110 cups:
\[
\frac{900 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 8 \text{ bags}
\]

Thus, Cecilia will use \boxed{8 bags of dog food in the first year.",5,0,

19,686,ar,"First, calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.

So the total time spent is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Next, determine the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking if her average speed is 4 miles per hour:
- The total distance is 12 miles.
- Her desired average speed is 4 miles per hour.

So the total time required is \(\frac{12}{4} = 3\) hours.

Now, calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to hike:
- She has already walked 4 miles and 2 miles, which totals 6 miles.
- The remaining distance is \(12 - 6 = 6\) miles.

Finally, determine the required speed for the remaining distance:
- The remaining distance is 6 miles.
- The remaining time is \(3 - 2 = 1\) hour.

So the required speed is \(\frac{6}{1} = 6\) miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Total cost for shorts: \(3 \times 16.50 = 49\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Total cost for pants: \(3 \times 22.50 = 67\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Total cost for shoes: \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

1. **Time spent watching TV each day:**
   Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each day.

2. **Time spent reading each day:**
   Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV each day. Therefore, he reads for \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour each day.

3. **Total time spent on TV and reading each day:**
   Total time = Time spent watching TV + Time spent reading
   Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours/day

4. **Total time spent on TV and reading each week:**
   Total time = Time spent on TV and reading each day × Number of days per week
   Total time = 3 hours/day × 3 days/week = 9 hours/week

5. **Total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks:**
   Total time = Time spent on TV and reading each week × Number of weeks
   Total time = 9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   Charlie starts with 10 stickers.

2. **Stickers Bought:**
   Charlie buys 21 stickers from a store in the mall.
   \[
   10 + 21 = 31

   So, Charlie now has 31 stickers.

3. **Stickers Received on Birthday:**
   Charlie receives 23 more stickers for his birthday.

   So, Charlie now has 54 stickers.

4. **Stickers Given to Sister and Used:**
   Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister and uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.
   \[

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - Given: There are two cats for every dog.
   - Number of dogs = 60.
   - Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120.

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - Number of dogs = 60.

   - Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180.

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - Given: The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168.

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[ 3 \times 68 = 204 \]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[ 6 \times 55 = 330 \]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, sum these costs to find the total cost:
\[ 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \]

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia eats in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs to cover the total number of servings.
3. Calculate the total cost of the cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia eats in 60 days.**
Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she eats:
\[ 60 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs.**
Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60}{15} = 4 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the cartons.**
Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

- For the first 180 days, the puppy consumes 1 cup of dog food per day.

- For the remaining days (365 days - 180 days = 185 days), the puppy consumes 2 cups of dog food per day.
  \[
  2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups}

Next, we need to figure out how many glasses Kylar will buy at the discounted price and how many at the full price.

3. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses in total.

6. The remaining 8 glasses will be bought at the full price.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

3. Divide the total by the number of friends.

First, let's break down the guesses:

- The second friend says 20 more than half of 80: \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.
- The third friend says 25% more than 80: \( 80 \times 1.25 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Next, we sum these guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Finally, we divide the total by the number of friends to find the average:

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges her $140 per month.
   - For 6 months, the cost is: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges her 10% less than the initial amount for the second half of the year.
   - 10% of $140 is: \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the new monthly charge is: \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - For the second 6 months, the cost is: \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

1. **Diamonds**:
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies**:
   - The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140

   - The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:

Now, we sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems:

2. The number of girls is the total number of students minus the number of boys:

47,734,ar,"1. John spends $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
2. Calculate the number of blue ties:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

3. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

4. The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie:
   \[
   \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 \times 1.5 = 60
   \]

5. Calculate the total cost of the red ties:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

6. Add the total cost of the blue and red ties:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 200 + 600 = 800
   \]

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in four weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire eats in one week. She makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate how many eggs she eats in four weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen:
\[ 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.",7,0,

1. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
2. Determine the difference between this distance and the reach of the dragon's flames.

First, we calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone. She can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone, and when holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance is:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we determine how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames this distance is. The reach of the dragon's flames is 1000 feet. The difference between the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone and the reach of the dragon's flames is:

\[ 1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet} \]",200,0,

47,750,ar,"First, let's determine the number of red ties John bought. Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, and he spent $200 on blue ties at $40 each, we calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Therefore, the number of red ties is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 \times 1.5 = 60
\]

Now, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 40 + 10 \times 60 = 200 + 600 = 800

1. **Determine the volume of the sauce used:**
   Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, and this is the remaining half of the volume after cooking. Therefore, the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes. To find the number of cans used, we divide the original volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[ 3 \times 68 = 204 \]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[ 6 \times 55 = 330 \]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

74,758,ar,"To determine how much Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling each type of flower and then sum these amounts.

1. **Marigolds:**
   - Price per pot: $2.74
   - Number of pots: 12
   - Revenue from marigolds: \(12 \times 2.74 = 32.88\)

2. **Petunias:**
   - Price per pot: $1.87
   - Number of pots: 9
   - Revenue from petunias: \(9 \times 1.87 = 16.83\)

3. **Begonias:**
   - Price per pot: $2.12
   - Number of pots: 17
   - Revenue from begonias: \(17 \times 2.12 = 36.04\)

Now, we sum the revenues from all three types of flowers:
\[
32.88 + 16.83 + 36.04 = 85.75

76,758,ar,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed by the puppy over the 365 days.

First, we calculate the amount of food consumed in the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of food consumed in the remaining 185 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of food consumed in one year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \]

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   The combined number of dogs and cats is:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Find the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Sum up all the pets:**
   The total number of pets is the sum of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

1. Identify the number of dogs.
2. Calculate the number of cats based on the given ratio.
3. Determine the number of rabbits based on the relationship with the combined number of dogs and cats.
4. Sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to get the total number of pets.

Given:
- Number of dogs = 60
- Number of cats = 2 times the number of dogs
- Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12

First, calculate the number of cats:
- Number of cats = 2 × 60 = 120

Next, calculate the number of rabbits:
- Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168

Finally, sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
- Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

25,798,ar,"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples. The cost of the chicken meal is $12. The cost of 5 packs of milk at $3 each is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars. The cost of 4 apples at $1.50 each is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars. Adding these costs together, we get:

\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\]

So, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $33. Marie paid a total of $50, so the cost of the pizza boxes is:

\[50 - 33 = 17\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so to find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box:

\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numeric result is:

\[
\boxed{2

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- So, for 18 flowers, he would need \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) packages.
- The cost is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- So, for 18 flowers, he would need \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) packages.
- The cost is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, let's determine the difference in cost:
- The savings is \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.",6,0,

To maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 0 hours. Since the remaining time is 0, this means she needs to walk the remaining distance at an infinite speed to achieve her desired average speed of 4 miles per hour.

1. **Calculate the weight capacity of the bridge:**
   The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.

2. **Determine the weight of the empty truck:**
   The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

3. **Calculate the maximum weight capacity available for the boxes:**
   Since the empty truck weighs 0 pounds, the maximum weight capacity available for the boxes is simply the weight capacity of the bridge.

4. **Determine the maximum number of boxes:**
   Each box weighs 15 pounds.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.

- Therefore, the total cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:

- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.

27,814,ar,"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings of ice cream in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream are needed to meet that number of servings.
3. Calculate the total cost of the cartons.

First, calculate the total number of servings in 60 days:
\[
1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

Next, determine how many cartons are needed to provide 60 servings:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

Finally, calculate the total cost of 4 cartons at $4.00 per carton:
\[
4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{ carton} = \$16.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[

1. If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000 per year.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Since Marcy works for 30 years, we need to check if she qualifies for the $50,000 annual pension. If she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000 per year. If she works for 30 years, which is less than 40 years, she does not qualify for the $50,000 annual pension.

Next, we check if she qualifies for the 5% of the value of the pension per year starting after 20 years. Since she works for 30 years, which is 10 years beyond 20 years, she qualifies for this pension.

Therefore, her annual pension will be 5% of the total pension value.

   - Initial salary = $600 per year
   - Increase = 10% of $600 = $600 * 0.10 = $60
   - New salary after one year = $600 + $60 = $660

2. Since Sylvie has already been with the company for 5 years, she is eligible for a salary increase.
   - After the first year, her salary is $660.
   - After the second year, her salary is $660 + $60 = $720.
   - After the third year, her salary is $720 + $60 = $780.

3. To find her annual salary after three more years of service, we need to consider the total number of years she has been with the company:
   - Total years = 5 + 3 = 8
   - Annual salary after three more years = $780 (from the third year)

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate this information into the following equations:

1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Now, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has before giving any away.
2. Determine the number of potted plants she will give away.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants.

First, let's find the total number of potted plants Mary has before giving any away:
- She received 18 new potted plants.
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the total number of potted plants is \(18 + 2 \times 40 = 18 + 80 = 98\).

Next, let's determine how many potted plants she will give away:
- She will give away 1 potted plant from each ledge.
- Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away 40 potted plants.

Now, we subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants:
- \(98 - 40 = \)",58,0,

2. The 5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so the total cost for the milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The 4 apples cost $1.50 each, so the total cost for the apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.
4. Let \(x\) be the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered. Each box costs $8.50, so the total cost for the pizzas is \(8.50x\) dollars.
5. The total cost of all items is given as $50, so we have the equation: \(12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50\).
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: \(33 + 8.50x = 50\).
7. Subtract 33 from both sides, we get: \(8.50x = 17\).
8. Divide both sides by 8.50, we get: \(x = 2\).

2. **Calculate the weight of the empty truck and the driver:**
   The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

3. **Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:**
   Subtract the weight of the empty truck and the driver from the total weight capacity.

2. Add Grace's weight to Alex's weight to get the combined weight.

First, we know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Since Grace weighs 125 pounds, we can calculate Alex's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 478 \]

Next, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight to find their combined weight:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 125 + 478 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
18x = 162
\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[
x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
\]

Now that we have \(x = 9\), we can find Allen's current age:

\[
\text{Allen's age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99

1. Calculate the number of articles she wrote on each day.
2. Determine the total number of articles written.
3. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written each day**

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of articles written**

Total number of articles = 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing**

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing = 26 \times 4 = 104\) hours.

1. Calculate the number of unripe oranges.
2. Sum the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges.
3. Subtract the sum from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges. Since the total number of oranges is 25 and 20% of them are unripe, we have:
\[ \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Next, sum the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges. The number of bad oranges is 1, the number of unripe oranges is 5, and the number of sour oranges is 2. Adding these together gives:
\[ 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 \]

Finally, subtract this sum from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. The total number of oranges is 25, so the number of good oranges is:
\[ 25 - 8 = 17 \]

70,854,ar,"First, let's determine the total number of dance classes Judy teaches in a week. On weekdays, she teaches 5 classes each day:

\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes} \]

On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of dance classes in a week:

\[ 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Each class has 15 students. Therefore, the total number of students in a week is:

\[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Judy charges $15.00 per student. So, the total earnings in a week are:

\[ 495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars} \]

41,862,ar,"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the javelin without holding the gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.
3. Determine the difference between the distance with the gemstone and the reach of the dragon's flames.

1. Polly can throw the javelin for 400 feet without holding the gemstone.
2. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the distance with the gemstone is:
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The dragon's flames reach within a distance of 1000 feet. The difference between the distance with the gemstone and the reach of the dragon's flames is:
   \[
   1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

\[

Next, we find the number of girls in the Grade 5. Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we calculate the number of girls in the Girl Scouts. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of girls in Girl Scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Finally, we find the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts by subtracting the number of girls in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls:
\[

1. **Calculate the number of eggs produced per week:**
   - Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs produced per week is:
     \[
     252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}

93,878,ar,"First, let's determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and Lee used to be two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, Gerald's original time is:

\[ 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

First, calculate 10% of Gerald's original time:

\[ 0.10 \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Then, add this to his original time to find his new time:

\[ 40 \text{ seconds} + 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in:

1. Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
2. Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child dinosaur eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) pounds of potato salad.
3. There are 20 adult dinosaurs, so the total amount of potato salad for the adults is:

4. There are 5 child dinosaurs, so the total amount of potato salad for the children is:

5. Adding the amounts for the adults and children gives the total amount of potato salad needed:

1. We know James is 10 years old.
2. Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, we can find Corey's age:
   \[
   \text{Corey's age} = \text{James's age} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]
3. We know Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. Let's use the information that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson to find Amy's age:
   \[
   \text{Amy's age} = \text{Amy's age} + 2 \implies \text{Amy's age} = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]
4. Now, using the information that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can solve for Jackson's age:
   \[
   \text{Jackson's age} = \text{Amy's age} - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \(3 \times 60 = 180\).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   - To find the number of downloads in the third month, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180.
   - 30% of 180 is \(0.30 \times 180 = 54\).
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is \(180 - 54 = 126\).

Now, we sum the downloads over the three months:
\[
60 + 180 + 126 = 366

1. Identify the number of instructions in the first recipe.
2. Calculate the number of instructions in the second recipe.
3. Add the number of instructions from both recipes to get the total.

**Step 1: Identify the number of instructions in the first recipe.**
The first recipe has 20 instructions.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of instructions in the second recipe.**
The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first recipe. Therefore, we calculate the number of instructions in the second recipe as follows:
\[ \text{Number of instructions in the second recipe} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

**Step 3: Add the number of instructions from both recipes to get the total.**
\[ \text{Total number of instructions} = \text{Number of instructions in the first recipe} + \text{Number of instructions in the second recipe} = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Thus, the total number of instructions Kelian has to read is \(60\).",60,0,

- The orange drink is two-thirds water, so in 10 liters, there is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \text{ liters} = 6 \text{ liters}
  \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so in 15 liters, there is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \text{ liters} = 9 \text{ liters}
  \]

Now, we add the water from both drinks:
\[
6 \text{ liters} + 9 \text{ liters} = 15 \text{ liters}
\]

However, one liter of the orange drink is spilled, so we need to subtract that:
\[
15 \text{ liters} - 1 \text{ liter} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

2. **James and Corey Relationship**: James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey's age is:

2. Since she can run four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.
3. In six hours, she spends one-third of the time running, so she runs for \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
4. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she walks for \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.
5. The distance she runs in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) miles.
6. The distance she walks in 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour is \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) miles.
7. Therefore, the total distance she travels in six hours is \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) miles.

1. Calculate the annual salary increase.
2. Determine the total salary increase over the next three years.
3. Add the total salary increase to her initial salary to find her new annual salary.

First, let's calculate the annual salary increase. The annual salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary each year. The initial salary is $600, so the annual salary increase is:
\[ 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total salary increase over the next three years. Since the annual increase is $60, the total increase over three years is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

Finally, we add the total salary increase to her initial salary to find her new annual salary. The initial salary is $600, so the new annual salary is:
\[ 600 + 180 = 780 \]

Therefore, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary is $780.",9360,0,

- As a teacher, she earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week:
  \[
  20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 35 \text{ hours/week} = 700 \text{ dollars/week}
  \]

- As a cheerleading coach, she earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week:
  \[

3. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs in a week.
4. Multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find the total earnings.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per day.
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

Step 2: Determine the total number of eggs produced in a week.
There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total number of eggs produced in a week is \(252 \times 7 = 1764\).

Step 3: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs in a week.
A dozen is 12 eggs. So, the number of dozens in a week is \(\frac{1764}{12} = 147\).

Step 4: Multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find the total earnings.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. So, the total earnings per week is \(147 \times 2 = 294\) dollars.",294,0,

1. Calculate the number of boys at the school.
2. Determine the total number of students at the school.
3. Calculate the number of teachers based on the given ratio.

First, we know there are 60 girls at the school. The number of boys is twice the number of girls:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of students:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

We are given that for every 5 students, there is 1 teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers is calculated as follows:

\[

First, let's calculate Judy's weekday earnings:
- She teaches 5 classes each day on weekdays.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Each class has 15 students, so each weekday, there are \(5 \times 15 = 75\) students.
- Each student pays $15.00, so her weekday earnings are \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate Judy's Saturday earnings:
- She teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students, so there are \(8 \times 15 = 120\) students on Saturday.
- Each student pays $15.00, so her Saturday earnings are \(120 \times 15 = 1800\) dollars.

3. Calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) by dividing the total miles driven by the gallons used.
4. Multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank.

First, we know that Sophia drove 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her miles per gallon (mpg) is:
\[
\frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg}

78,950,ar,"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the total costs for each option.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two options:
- The difference is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Thus, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.

   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Since her skipping speed is half her running speed, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. Determine Dana's walking speed.
   - Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. Calculate the distance Dana runs in six hours.
   - She spends one-third of the time running, so she runs for \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Her running speed is 6 miles per hour, so the distance she runs in 2 hours is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) miles.

4. Calculate the total distance Dana walks in six hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.
   - Since she does not run, the total distance she walks is 0 miles.",18,0,

1. **Determine how much laundry David does:**
   - We know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, David does \(\frac{400}{4} = 100\) pounds of laundry.

2. **Determine how much laundry Raymond does:**
   - We know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, Raymond does \(\frac{400}{2} = 200\) pounds of laundry.

3. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:**
   - Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.
   - David does 100 pounds of laundry.

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

We are given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find out how many girls are in the girl scout, we multiply the number of girls by 2/3:

\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80

Finally, the number of girls who are not in the girl scout is:

1. Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is currently 34 years old. Therefore, he has been vacationing for:
   \[
   34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
   \]

2. Gene goes on four vacations each year. Over the course of 11 years, the total number of vacations he has taken is:
   \[
   11 \times 4 = 44 \text{ vacations}
   \]

3. Since each vacation results in one souvenir t-shirt, each t-shirt is a quilt block. Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations:
   \[
   44 \text{ quilt blocks}
   \]

Thus, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:

Next, calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:

Now, add the amounts of water from both drinks:
\[ 7 \text{ liters} + 9 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

But one liter of the orange drink was spilled, so the total amount of water is:

Finally, calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:

We know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Since Seattle has 20 sheep, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse.
We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Since Charleston has 80 sheep, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of sheep in all three cities.
We add the number of sheep in Charleston, Seattle, and Toulouse:
\[ \text{Total number of sheep} = 80 + 20 + 160 = 260 \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep that the three cities have together is \(260\boxed{}.\)",260,0,

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Total cost for shorts = 3 * $16.50 = $49.50

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- One pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Total cost for pants = 3 * $22.50 = $67.50

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- One pair of shoes costs $42.
- Total cost for shoes = 3 * $42 = $126

Now, we sum up the costs for all the clothing items:
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Let's start with the 25% fee:

\[
25\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = \$10.00
\]

So, the bill after the 25% fee is:

\[
\$40.00 + \$10.00 = \$50.00
\]

Next, we add the delivery fee of $3.00:

\[
\$50.00 + \$3.00 = \$53.00

So, Raymond was born in 2005.

Then, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, Raymond's son was born:

80,998,ar,"To determine how many liters of water were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water each girl received.
2. Subtract the total amount of water given to the girls and the boy from the total amount of water.

First, let's calculate the amount of water each girl received. Since there are two girls and each girl received \(\frac{1}{6}\) of the 24 liters, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]
So, each girl received 4 liters of water.

Next, we need to find the total amount of water given to the girls and the boy. The total amount of water given to the girls is:
\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters}
\]
Adding this to the water given to the boy, we have:
\[
8 + 6 = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water given from the total amount of water left:
\[
24 - 14 = 10 \text{ liters}

1. **First friend's guess:**
   - The first friend says 80 jelly beans.

2. **Second friend's guess:**
   - The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
   - Half of 80 is 40.
   - Adding 20 to 40 gives 60.

3. **Third friend's guess:**
   - The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess.
   - 25% of 80 is 20.
   - Adding 20 to 80 gives 100.

Next, we sum up the guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Now, we find the average guess by dividing the total sum by the number of friends:
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

Thus, the average guess is \(80\).",80,0,

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance without the gemstone:**
   Polly could throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone.

2. **Calculate Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   With the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin three times farther than without it. Therefore, the distance is:
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   The dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from her throwing distance with the gemstone:
   \[
   1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet}

1. Calculate the number of boys at the school.
2. Find the total number of students at the school.
3. Determine the number of teachers based on the given ratio of students to teachers.

First, we know there are 60 girls at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

We are told that there are 5 students to every teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers is the total number of students divided by 5:
\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is:

3. Divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average.

Let's start with the given information:

- Each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it.

We can express the square footage of each level as follows:

- Second level: 16 / 2 = 8
- Third level: 8 / 2 = 4
- Fourth level: 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:

63,1022,ar,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

1. **First half of the year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total cost for the first half: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \).

2. **Second half of the year:**
   - The streaming service charges $10% less per month for the second half.
   - The new monthly charge is \( 140 - 0.10 \times 140 = 126 \).
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half: \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \).

3. **Total amount paid by the end of the year:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first half + Cost for the second half
   - Total cost = $840 + $756 = \boxed{596",1596,0,

74,1022,ar,"To determine how much Artie will make from selling the flowers, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then sum these amounts. We will round all prices to the nearest dollar before performing the calculations.

First, let's round each price to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 \approx \$3$
- Petunias: $1.87 \approx \$2$
- Begonias: $2.12 \approx \$2$

Next, we calculate the revenue for each type of flower:
- Revenue from marigolds: $12 \text{ pots} \times \$3/\text{pot} = \$36$
- Revenue from petunias: $9 \text{ pots} \times \$2/\text{pot} = \$18$
- Revenue from begonias: $17 \text{ pots} \times \$2/\text{pot} = \$34$

Now, we sum the revenues to find the total amount Artie will make:
\[
\$36 + \$18 + \$34 = \$88
\]

94,1022,ar,"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Determine the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   The combined number of dogs and cats is the sum of the number of dogs and the number of cats:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[
60 + 120 + 168 = 348
\]
