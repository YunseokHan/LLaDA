33,5,ar,"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
2. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be expressed as \( S + 30 \).
3. The total number of coins is the sum of the silver coins and the gold coins, which is given as 110. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   S + (S + 30) = 110
   \]
4. Simplify the equation by combining like terms:
   \[
   2S + 30 = 110
   \]
5. Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
   \[
   2S = 80
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 40
   \]
7. Therefore, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \)",70,0,

44,5,ar,"First, let's determine the total cost of supplies for making 20 candles. Since each candle requires 1/10 pound of beeswax, 20 candles will require:
\[
20 \times \frac{1}{10} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
\]
Each pound of beeswax costs $10.00, so 2 pounds of beeswax will cost:
\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle sells for $2.00, so the revenue from 20 candles is:
\[
20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[
\boxed{20

1. **Calculate the total weight capacity of the bridge:**
   The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.

2. **Calculate the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck:**
   The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is given as 3755 pounds.

3. **Calculate the remaining weight capacity:**
   Subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the total weight capacity of the bridge.
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded:**
   Each box weighs 15 pounds. Divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

2. Determine the number of vacations he has taken over these years.
3. Conclude that the number of quilt blocks is equal to the number of vacations, since each vacation has a unique t-shirt.

First, we calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing. Gene started vacationing when he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. Therefore, he has been vacationing for:
\[ 34 - 23 = 11 \]

Next, we determine the number of vacations he has taken over these years. Since he goes on 4 vacations each year, the total number of vacations over 11 years is:
\[ 11 \times 4 = 44 \]

Finally, we conclude that the number of quilt blocks is equal to the number of vacations, since each vacation has a unique t-shirt. Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Each floor contains 8 units, and there are 15 floors:
\[
15 \times 8 = 120
\]
So, there are 120 units in total.

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we calculate:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]
So, 90 units are occupied.

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:
\[
120 - 90 = 30
\]
So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

77,37,ar,"To solve the problem step by step, let's start by defining the variables and using the given relationships.

1. Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does.
2. Let \( R \) represent the amount of laundry Raymond does.
3. Let \( S \) represent the amount of laundry Sarah does.

From the problem, we know:
- \( S = 400 \) pounds (since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry)
- \( S = 4D \) (Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David)
- \( R = \frac{S}{2} \) (Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah)

First, solve for David's laundry:
\[ S = 4D \]
\[ 400 = 4D \]
\[ D = 100 \]

Next, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ R - D = \frac{S}{2} - D = \frac{400}{2} - 100 = 200 - 100 = 100\]

\boxed{100",100,0,
78,37,ar,"First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3.

Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.

To find out how many packages Vincent needs:
\[
\frac{18}{3} = 6
\]

So, the total cost is:
\[
6 \times 2.50 = 15
\]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.

Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.

To find out how many packages Vincent needs:
\[
\frac{18}{2} = 9
\]

So, the total cost is:
\[
9 \times 1 = 9
\]

Next, we compare the costs to determine the savings:

- Cost with packages of 3: $15
- Cost with packages of 2: $9

The savings is:
\[
15 - 9 = 6
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:
\[
\boxed{6

46,45,ar,"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice started with:**
   - Candice put 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
   - She purchased a package of Post-it notes.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package.
   - Total Post-it notes initially: \( 80 + x \)

2. **Determine the total number of Post-it notes used and remaining:**
   - Candice used 220 Post-it notes for the coffee cups.
   - She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.
   - Total Post-it notes used: \( 220 \)
   - Total Post-it notes remaining: \( 23 \)
   - Total Post-it notes initially: \( 220 + 23 = 243 \)

3. **Set up the equation and solve for \( x \):**
   - \( 80 + x = 243 \)
   - \( x = 163 \)

3,69,ar,"To determine how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance James runs each day:**
   - James runs 3 sprints each day.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters long.
   - Therefore, the distance he runs each day is:
     \[
     3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days James runs in a week:**
   - James runs 3 times a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days he runs in a week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total distance James runs in a week:**
   - Since he runs 180 meters each day and he runs 3 days a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
     \[
     180 \times 3 = 540 \text{ meters}
     \]

Thus, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.",540,0,

11,69,ar,"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the mini cupcakes cost $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]
So, the mini cupcakes cost $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]
So, the mini cheesecakes cost $330.

Now, we sum up all the costs to find the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

33,69,ar,"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

We know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.

First, we express these relationships with equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate one of the variables:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we have \( S \), we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.",70,0,

47,85,ar,"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties and each blue tie costs $40, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, we calculate the cost of one red tie:

\[
\text{Cost of one red tie} = 0.5 \times 40 = 40
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for all the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 40 = 400
\]

Finally, the total amount spent on ties is:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 400 = 600",800,0,

2. She runs at twice her skipping speed, so her running speed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.

4. Dana spends one-third of the time running, so she runs for \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
5. Dana spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she walks for \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.
6. The distance she runs is the product of her running speed and the time she runs, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.
7. The distance she walks is the product of her walking speed and the time she walks, which is \(1.5 \times 4 = 6\) miles.

Next, calculate the total calories in a 300g bag of chips, which contains 5 servings:
\[
250 \text{ calories per serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories}
\]

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. The remaining calories you can consume are:
\[
2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

Since one serving contains 250 calories, the number of servings you can consume is:
\[
\frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories per serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings}
\]

Each serving contains 300 grams, so:

1. Calculate the distance Tom traveled from 1 PM to 4 PM.
2. Determine the time it takes to travel the same distance back at a rate of 6 mph.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled. He sailed from 1 PM to 4 PM for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to find how long it takes Tom to travel 30 miles back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours}

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats and uses for muffins from the total number of eggs.
3. Determine the number of eggs remaining for sale.
4. Calculate the revenue from selling these eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.**
Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

**Step 2: Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats and uses for muffins from the total number of eggs.**
Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for muffins. So, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

**Step 3: Determine the number of eggs remaining for sale.**
The number of eggs remaining for sale is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

**Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling these eggs.**
Janet sells each egg for $2, so the revenue from selling 9 eggs is $9 \times 2 = $18.

1. **Westward Travel:**
   - Both trains travel 80 miles westward.
   - Therefore, the distance covered in westward travel for each train is 80 miles.

2. **Northward Travel:**
   - Both trains travel 150 miles northward.
   - Therefore, the distance covered in northward travel for each train is 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we add the distances covered in westward and northward travel:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance covered in westward travel} + \text{Distance covered in northward travel} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

25,117,ar,"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items other than the pizza. The cost of one pack of milk is $3, and Marie ordered 5 packs. The cost of one apple is $1.50, and Marie ordered 4 apples.

\[
3 \times 5 = 15
\]
\[
1.50 \times 4 = 6
\]

Next, we add the cost of the chicken meal to the total cost of the milk and apples.

\[
12 + 15 + 6 = 33
\]

The total amount paid by Marie is $50. Therefore, the cost of the pizza boxes is:

\[
50 - 33 = 17
\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box.

\[
\frac{17}{8.50} = 2
\]

Thus, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

2,125,ar,"First, we need to determine the total initial investment. Josh bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs. So, the total initial investment is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Next, we calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. Therefore, the new value is:
\[ 80,000 \times 150/100 = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

The profit Joshua made is the difference between the new value of the house and the total initial investment, which is the amount he spent on the house plus the amount he spent on repairs. Thus, the profit is:
\[ 120,000 - 130,000 = -10,000 \]

Since the profit is negative, Joshua actually incurred a loss. The final result is:

1. Calculate the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday.
3. Calculate the total number of hours spent on each day.
4. Sum the total hours spent over the three days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.**
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more on Tuesday.
\[ 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.**
Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours spent on each day.**
Each article takes 4 hours to research and write.

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue for Thursday.**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 per tire: \(6 \times 60 = 360\)
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 per tire: \(4 \times 40 = 160\)
- Total revenue for Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue for Friday.**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 per tire: \(12 \times 40 = 480\)
- No truck tires are repaired on Friday, so the revenue from truck tires is \(0\) dollars.
- Total revenue for Friday: \(480 + 0 = 480\) dollars

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday.**
- Revenue difference: \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know there are two cats for every dog.
   - Given that the number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \( 60 + 120 = 180 \).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is \( 180 - 12 = 168 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the dogs, cats, and rabbits.
   - This sum is \( 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \).

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(348\).",348,0,

46,141,ar,"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of Post-it notes used:**
   Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes used is:
   \[
   220
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had before purchasing the package:**
   Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 and had 23 remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is:
   \[
   220 + 23 = 243
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of Post-it notes in the package:**
   Since Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is 243, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:
   \[
   243 - 80 = 243
   \]

97,141,ar,"To solve the problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the volume of the sauce and the original volume of the tomatoes. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the volume of the sauce is twice the original volume of the tomatoes.

Given that Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, we can determine the original volume of the tomatoes by dividing the volume of the sauce by 2:

\[
\text{Original volume of tomatoes} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \text{ ounces}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes Freda used. Since each can contains 16 ounces of tomato, we divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of one can:

\[
\text{Number of cans} = \frac{16}{16} = 1
\]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[
\text{Total number of tomatoes} = 1 \times 3 = 3
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3

1. Marigolds:
   - Price per pot of marigolds: $2.74
   - Number of pots sold: 12
   - Revenue from marigolds: $2.74 \times 12 = $32.88

2. Petunias:
   - Price per pot of petunias: $1.87
   - Number of pots sold: 9
   - Revenue from petunias: $1.87 \times 9 = $16.83

3. Begonias:
   - Price per pot of begonias: $2.12
   - Number of pots sold: 17
   - Revenue from begonias: $2.12 \times 17 = $36.04

According to the given ratio, we can write:
\[
\frac{d}{a} = \frac{7}{11}
\]

Since their total age is 162, we can write:
\[
d + a = 162
\]

Let's solve these equations step-by-step. Express \( d \) in terms of \( a \):
\[
d = \frac{7}{11}a
\]

Substitute this into the total age equation:
\[
\frac{7}{11}a + a = 162
\]
Simplify the equation:
\[
\frac{18}{11}a = 162
\]
Solve for \( a \):
\[
a = \frac{162 \times 11}{18} = 91
\]

Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[
a + 10 = 91 + 10 = 101
\]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we calculate the number of girls in the class. The total number of students is 200, and 80 are boys:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout. To find the number of girls in the Girl Scout, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the Girl Scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Finally, we determine the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout by subtracting the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in the Girl Scout} = 120 - 80 = 40

1. Calculate the 25% delivery fee.
2. Add the delivery fee to the total bill.
3. Add the delivery fee to the total bill.
4. Add the tip to the total bill.

Let's start with the first step:

\[
\text{Delivery fee} = 25\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = \$10.00
\]

Next, we add the delivery fee to the total bill:

\[
\text{Final bill after delivery fee} = \$40.00 + \$10.00 = \$50.00
\]

Then, we add the delivery fee to the total bill:

\[
\text{Final bill after delivery fees} = \$50.00 + \$3.00 = \$53.00
\]

Finally, we add the tip to the total bill:

1. Determine each friend's guess.
2. Add all the guesses together.
3. Divide the total sum by the number of friends.

First, let's find the guesses for each friend:

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half of 80:
   - Half of 80 is 40.
   - 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend says 25% more than 80:
   - 25% of 80 is 20.
   - 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add all the guesses together:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Finally, we divide the total sum by the number of friends:
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80.",80,0,

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \(3 \times 60 = 180\).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the third month reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   - To find the number of downloads in the third month, we calculate 30% of the second month's downloads and subtract it from the second month's total.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is \(180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126\).

First, let's calculate the distance traveled during the first part of the trip. Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. The distance is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back to the same distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours}
\]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Tom to get back is:

74,197,ar,"To determine Artie's total earnings, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of flower and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the marigolds:
- Price per pot of marigolds: $2.74
- Number of pots of marigolds: 12
- Revenue from marigolds: $2.74 * 12 = $33

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the petunias:
- Price per pot of petunias: $1.87
- Number of pots of petunias: 9
- Revenue from petunias: $1.87 * 9 = $17

Finally, let's calculate the revenue from the begonias:
- Price per pot of begonias: $2.12
- Number of pots of begonias: 17
- Revenue from begonias: $2.12 * 17 = $37

Now, we sum the revenues to find the total earnings:
\[
33 + 17 + 37 = 87
\]

47,205,ar,"First, let's determine the number of blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties and each blue tie costs $40.

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, let's determine the number of red ties John bought. He bought twice as many red ties as blue ties.

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, let's determine the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the ties. There are 5 blue ties and 10 red ties.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 40 + 10 \times 60 = 200 + 600 = 800

2. Determine the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.
3. Calculate the difference in cost between buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and 2.

1. To find the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3, divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per package and then multiply by the cost per package:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 18 flowers in packages of 3} = \left(\frac{18}{3}\right) \times 2.50 = 6 \times 2.50 = 15
   \]

2. To find the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2, since each package costs $1:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 18 flowers in packages of 2} = 18
   \]

3. Calculate the difference in cost:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 18 - 15 = 3

1. **Marigolds:**
   - Price per pot: $2.74
   - Number of pots: 12
   - Total from marigolds: \(12 \times 2.74 = 32.88\)

2. **Petunias:**
   - Price per pot: $1.87
   - Number of pots: 9
   - Total from petunias: \(9 \times 1.87 = 16.83\)

3. **Begonias:**
   - Price per pot: $2.12
   - Number of pots: 17
   - Total from begonias: \(17 \times 2.12 = 36.04\)

Now, we sum up the total sales from all types of flowers:

1. Calculate Sylvie's initial annual salary.
2. Determine the increase in salary after the first year.
3. Calculate the new salary after the first year.
4. Determine the increase in salary after the third year.
5. Calculate the final salary after the third year.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. Therefore, her initial annual salary is:
\[ 600 \times 12 = 7200 \]

First, calculate the increase in salary after the first year:
\[ 7200 \times 0.10 = 720 \]
So, her salary after the first year is:
\[ 7200 + 720 = 7920 \]

Next, calculate the increase in salary after the third year:

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   We know that there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

4. **Find the total number of pets:**
   The total number of pets is the sum of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of clothing:
- One pair of shorts costs $16.50, so for 3 pairs: \( 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \)
- One pair of pants costs $22.50, so for 3 pairs: \( 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \)
- One pair of shoes costs $42, so for 3 pairs: \( 3 \times 42 = 126 \)

Now, we add up the total costs for all the clothing items:
- Total cost of shorts: $49.50
- Total cost of pants: $67.50
- Total cost of shoes: $126

\( 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \)

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items.

33,253,ar,"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of silver coins by \( S \) and the number of gold coins by \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( G \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we know there are 40 silver coins:
\[ G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.",70,0,

2. Calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the rest of the year.
3. Add the two amounts to find the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in one year.

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy eats 1 cup per day.
   - Total food in the first 180 days = 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

2. For the next 180 days, the puppy eats 2 cups per day.
   - Total food in the next 180 days = 2 cups/day * 180 days = 360 cups.

3. Total food in one year = 180 cups + 360 cups = 540 cups.

4. To find the number of bags needed, divide the total amount of food by the amount per bag:
   - Number of bags = 540 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5.

2. Determine the number of boys.
3. Calculate the number of girls.
4. Find out how many girls are in the Girl Scout.
5. Subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls.

First, let's find the number of boys:
\[

\]

Next, we calculate the number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

Now, we determine how many girls are in the Girl Scout:
\[
\text{Number of girls in Girl Scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80

1. **Determine Gerald's initial time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's initial time is:
     \[
     38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculate Gerald's new time:**
   - Gerald's diet improvement increases his speed by 10%.
   - To find the new time, we calculate 10% of Gerald's initial time and subtract it from his initial time.
   - 10% of 40 seconds is:
     \[
     0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}

   - Subtract this from Gerald's initial time:

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

77,269,ar,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given and calculate the amounts of laundry each person does step by step.

1. **Sarah's Laundry:**
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

2. **David's Laundry:**
   - Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does.
   - Therefore, \( 4D = 400 \).
   - Solving for \( D \):
     \[
     D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Raymond's Laundry:**
   - Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Therefore, Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

4. **Difference in Laundry:**
   - The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
     \[
     R - D = 200 - 100 = 100
     \]

2. According to the problem, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. To find the total number of sheep in all three cities, we add the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160

   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = 260

84,277,ar,"To solve this problem, let's define the variables first.

Let \( W \) be the number of games won, and let \( L \) be the number of games lost.

We know the following from the problem:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more than they lost.

We can translate these into the following equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of losses (\( L \)) is 7, we can find the number of wins (\( W \)) by substituting back into the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

1. **Calculate the number of sprints in a week:**
   - James runs 3 sprints each day.
   - He runs 3 times a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of sprints in a week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ sprints/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance per week:**
   - Each sprint is 60 meters.
   - There are 9 sprints per week.
   - Therefore, the total distance in a week is:
     \[
     9 \text{ sprints/week} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
     \]

So, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week.

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had in her purse from the total number of Post-it notes used to find out how many she purchased.

First, let's find the total number of Post-it notes Candice used. She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee and had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she used is:

\[
220 \text{ cups} + 23 \text{ remaining} = 243 \text{ Post-it notes}
\]

Next, we subtract the number of Post-it notes she had in her purse from the total number of Post-it notes used. She initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse, so:

\[
243 - 80 = 163
\]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:

1. Calculate the total weight of the comic books.
2. Subtract the total weight of the comic books from the total weight to be removed to find the remaining weight needed.
3. Divide the remaining weight needed by the weight of each toy to find the number of toys required.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books. Uriah removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we subtract the total weight of the comic books from the total weight to be removed. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds.

\[

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the original cost of the house from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000, and the repairs increased the value by 150%.

\[
\text{New value} = 80,000 + (80,000 \times 0.15) = 80,000 + 12,000 = 92,000
\]

Next, we subtract the original cost of the house from the new value to find the profit. The original cost of the house is $80,000.

\[
\text{Profit} = 92,000 - 80,000 = 12,000

First, let's calculate the total amount of feed required for all chickens in a day:
- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
- Wendi has 20 chickens.
- Total feed required = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken
- Total feed required = 20 chickens × 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Next, let's subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total required:
- Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning.
- Wendi gives 25 cups in the afternoon.
- Total feed given = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Therefore, the remaining feed needed in the final meal is:

We know that Kyle paid $19.50, so we can write the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50 \times 10}{0.75 \times 10} = \frac{195}{7} \]

Next, we calculate the value of \( \frac{195}{7} \):
\[ P = 27 \]

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units:

\[
15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. The problem states that 3/4 of the building is occupied. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

So, there are 90 occupied units.

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:

1. Calculate the cost of the donuts:
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Cost per dozen donuts: $68.
   - Total cost for donuts: \(3 \times 68 = 204\).

2. Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cupcakes: $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes: \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

3. Calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cheesecakes: $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes: \(6 \times 55 = 330\).

First, let's identify the time period the candle has been burning:
- The candle starts burning at 1:00 PM and stops at 5:00 PM.
- To find the duration, we calculate the difference between the two times:
  \[
  5:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, we know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. Therefore, we multiply the number of hours by the melting rate:
\[
4 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ cm/hour} = 8 \text{ centimeters}
\]

Thus, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

- The second friend estimates \(80 / 2 + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60\) jelly beans.
- The third friend estimates \(80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100\) jelly beans.

**Step 2: Sum the estimates.**

\[

**Step 3: Divide the sum by the number of friends.**

\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

This means he bought 5 blue ties. Since he bought twice as many red ties, the number of red ties is:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie, which is $40. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Now, we calculate the total cost for all the ties:

2. The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

3. First, we need to find out how much weight the boxes can carry, considering the driver and the empty truck have already used up 3755 pounds.

4. Subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}

5. Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded, divide the remaining weight limit by the weight of each box:
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83.
   \]

6. The result, 83, represents the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83 boxes.

31,349,ar,"To find the average guess, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the individual guesses from each friend.
2. Sum the guesses.
3. Divide the sum by the number of friends.

Let's start with the individual guesses:

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend says \(40 + 20 = 60\) jelly beans.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend says \(80 + 20 = 100\) jelly beans.

Now, we sum the guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. \]

Finally, we divide the sum by the number of friends to find the average guess:
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80. \]

So, the average guess is \(80\).",80,0,

   - Orange drink is 10 liters and 2/3 of it is water.
   - Water in orange drink = 10 liters * (2/3) = 10 liters.

2. Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
   - Pineapple drink is 15 liters and 3/5 of it is water.
   - Water in pineapple drink = 15 liters * (3/5) = 9 liters.

3. Calculate the total amount of water before any spill:
   - Total water = Water in orange drink + Water in pineapple drink = 10 liters + 9 liters = 19 liters.

4. Calculate the amount of water after the spill:
   - 1 liter of orange drink is spilled, which contains (2/3) of water = (1/3) of 10 liters = (1/3) liters.
   - Water left = Total water - Water spilled = 19 liters - 1/3 liters = 18/3 liters.

- She can skip at 3 miles per hour.
- She can run at 6 miles per hour (since she can skip at 3 and run at 2).
- She can walk at 1.5 miles per hour (since she can run at 6 and walk at $\frac{3}{2}$).

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Let $t$ be the total time in hours. Then, she runs for $\frac{1}{3}t$ hours and walks for $\frac{2}{3}t$ hours. We know that the total time is 6 hours, so we can write:

$$\frac{1}{3}t + \frac{2}{3}t = 6 \implies t = 6.$$

Therefore, Dana runs for $2$ hours and walks for $4$ hours. The distance she runs is $6 \times 2 = 12$ miles, and the distance she walks is $1.5 \times 4 = 6$ miles. The total distance she travels is $12 + 6 = \boxed{",18,0,

12,365,ar,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to compare the initial cost of planting the tree to the annual revenue generated from the lemons and the annual expenses.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
- Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons.
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the net annual revenue after accounting for the cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.
- Therefore, the net annual revenue is \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net revenue to equal the initial cost of planting the tree:
- The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The net annual revenue is $7.5.
- Therefore, it will take \(\frac{90}{7.5} = 12\) years.

7,373,ar,"Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute. Normally, she can download 200 GB in 100 minutes. However, she has to restart after 40% of the download. 

First, calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file:
\[
40\% \text{ of } 200 \text{ GB} = 0.4 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}
\]

Next, calculate the time it takes to download 80 GB at a speed of 2 GB/minute:
\[
\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

After the restart, Carla takes 20 minutes to install updates. Then, she starts the download from the beginning again, which takes another 100 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is:
\[
40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes}

12,373,ar,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net income per year and then find out how many years it will take for the net income to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.

First, let's calculate the net income per year:
- Each year, Carlos sells 7 lemons at $1.5 each, so the annual income from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.
- Each year, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree.
- Therefore, the net income per year is \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net income to cover the initial cost of planting the tree:
- The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The net income per year is $7.5.
- To find out how many years it will take, we divide the initial cost by the net income per year: \(\frac{90}{7.5} = 12\).

36,397,ar,"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in a day.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
3. Find the total cost based on the sale price.

First, we know that Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.

Next, we calculate how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[
30 \div 3 = 10
\]
So, Terry eats 10 sets of 4 yogurts in 30 days.

Now, we calculate the total cost based on the sale price of 4 yogurts for $5.00. Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, we need to find out the cost for 10 sets:
\[
10 \times 5 = 50
\]
Therefore, Terry spends $50.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final numeric result is:
\[

11,413,ar,"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, we sum up these costs:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = \boxed{694

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) packages.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) packages.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, let's find the difference in cost:
- The savings are \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars.

Thus, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.",6,0,

1. **Calculate the annual pension for the first 20 years:**
   - Marcy works for 40 years and gets an annual pension of $50,000.
   - For the first 20 years, she receives a full pension of $50,000 each year.

2. **Calculate the annual pension for the remaining 10 years:**
   - After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the pension per year.
   - Therefore, her annual pension is \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\) dollars per year.

3. **Sum the pension for the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years:**
   - Total pension = \(50,000 \times 20 + 2,500 \times 10\)

1. Calculate how much James slept.
2. Subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep.

First, we know that Harry slept 9 hours. James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept. Therefore, we calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{18}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we find the difference between Harry's and James's sleep:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - \frac{18}{3} = \frac{27}{3} - \frac{18}{3} = \frac{9}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, Harry slept \(\frac{9}{3}\) hours more than James. To express this in a numerical form, we can convert it to a decimal or leave it as a fraction. The final answer is:

\[

86,429,ar,"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each instance of the alarm going off and then sum them up.

1. **First Time:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second Time:**
   - The alarm rang for three times as long as the first time.
   - Since it rang 4 times on the first occasion, on the second occasion it rang \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times.

3. **Third Time:**
   - The alarm rang for half as long as the second time.
   - Since it rang 12 times on the second occasion, on the third occasion it rang \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.

Now, we sum up the number of rings from all three instances:

- First time: 4 rings
- Second time: 12 rings
- Third time: 6 rings

Adding these together:
\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

Therefore, the total number of times the alarm rang in all is \(22\).",22,0,

1. Calculate the number of downloads in the second month.
2. Calculate the number of downloads in the third month.
3. Sum the number of downloads from all three months.

First, we know the number of downloads in the first month is 60. According to the problem, the number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month. Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Next, we calculate the number of downloads in the third month. The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% compared to the second month. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 - 0.30 \times 180 = 180 - 54 = 126 \]

Finally, we sum the number of downloads from all three months to find the total:

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy consumes 1 cup of dog food every day:
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}

2. For the remaining 180 days, the puppy consumes 2 cups of dog food every day:
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 360 \text{ cups}

Adding these two amounts together gives us:
\[
180 + 360 = 540 \text{ cups}

Since one bag contains 110 cups of dog food, the number of bags required is:
\[
\frac{540}{110} = 5 \text{ bags}

- She walked 4 miles in the first hour.
- She walked 2 miles in the second hour.

- She walked the next 2 miles in 1 hour.
- Total time spent: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

To complete the entire 12-mile trail, she has \(12 - 6 = 6\) miles left to walk.

She has \(2 - 2 = 0\) hours left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 2 hours.

32,461,ar,"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Calculate the total daily time for all dogs:**
   - John takes care of 10 dogs.
   - Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
   - Therefore, the total daily time for all dogs is:
     \[
     10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total weekly time for all dogs:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The total daily time for all dogs is 5 hours.
   - Therefore, the total weekly time for all dogs is:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs.

The final result is:

47,461,ar,"To determine how much John spent on ties, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of one red tie:**
   - Blue ties cost $40 each.
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - Therefore, the cost of one red tie is \( 40 \times 1.5 = 60 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the number of red ties John buys:**
   - John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - He spent $200 on blue ties.
   - The number of blue ties is \( \frac{200}{40} = 5 \).
   - Therefore, the number of red ties is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of all the red and blue ties:**
   - Total cost for blue ties: \( 5 \times 40 = 200 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for red ties: \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \) dollars.

1. Dana's skipping speed is given as 3 miles per hour.
2. Dana's running speed is twice her skipping speed, so her running speed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.
3. Dana's walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, so her walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance Dana travels running and walking in six hours.

1. She spends one-third of the time running, so she runs for \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
2. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she walks for \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.
3. The distance she runs is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) miles.
4. The distance she walks is \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) miles.

First, we know that Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy:

\]

Now, we add the number of pets each person has to find the total:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of pets Cindy has} + \text{Number of pets Marcia has} + \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats from the total number of eggs laid to find out how many eggs she has left to sell.
3. Multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg to find her daily earnings.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
- The number of eggs laid per day is 16.

Step 2: Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats from the total number of eggs laid.
- Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for her friends, so she eats a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.
- Therefore, the number of eggs left to sell is 16 - 7 = 9.

Step 3: Multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg.
- Janet sells 9 eggs at $2 per egg, so her daily earnings are 9 * 2 = $18.

1. **First friend's guess:**
   - The first friend says 80 jelly beans.

2. **Second friend's guess:**
   - The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
   - Half of 80 is \( 40 \).
   - Adding 20 to 40 gives \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).

3. **Third friend's guess:**
   - The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess.
   - 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).
   - Adding 20 to 80 gives \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).

4. **Calculate the total average:**
   - The total average is \( \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \).",80,0,

- Next 185 days: \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \)

1. Calculate the number of cats.
2. Calculate the number of rabbits.
3. Sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to get the total number of pets.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of cats.**

We know there are 60 dogs, and for every dog, there are 2 cats. Therefore, the number of cats is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of rabbits.**

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
\[ 60 + 120 = 180 \]
So, the number of rabbits is:
\[ 180 - 12 = 168 \]

**Step 3: Sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.**

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[ 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

\[ 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the costs. The initial cost of planting the tree is $90, and there is an additional $3 cost for watering and feeding each year. Therefore, the total annual cost is:

\[ 90 + 3 = 93 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to compare the annual income to the total annual cost. We set up the inequality:

\[ 10.5 > 93 \]

Since $10.5 is never greater than $93, it is clear that the tree will never earn money. Therefore, it will never start earning money.

Thus, the number of years it will take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree is:

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has \( \frac{x}{3} \) left.
2. She sold 2 more at the red house, so she has \( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \) left.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has \( \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{\frac{x}{3} - 2}{2} \) left.
4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{6} + 1 = \frac{x}{6} - 1 \).

We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

\[
\frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{x}{6} = 6

68,509,ar,"First, we need to determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. According to the problem, there are twice as many boys as girls. Given that there are 60 girls, we calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of girls and the number of boys:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

We know there are 5 students to every teacher. Therefore, we can determine the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by the ratio of students to teachers:

\[
\text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[

1. Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.
3. Sum the number of articles written over the three days.
4. Multiply the total number of articles by the average number of hours per article.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.**

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote \(5 \times \frac{2}{5} = 2\) articles more than on Monday.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.**

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) articles.

**Step 3: Sum the number of articles written over the three days.**

Total articles = 5 + 2 + 4 = 11

**Step 4: Multiply the total number of articles by the average number of hours per article.**

Total hours = \(11 \times 4 = 44\)",104,0,

First, let's calculate the cost for buying 18 flowers in packages of 3.

1. Determine the number of packages needed: \( \left\lceil \frac{18}{3} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 6 \right\rceil = 6 \) packages.
2. Calculate the total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.

1. Determine the number of packages needed: \( \left\lceil \frac{18}{2} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 9 \right\rceil = 9 \) packages.
2. Calculate the total cost: \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the total costs. The package in sets of 3 costs $15, and the package in sets of 2 costs $9. Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying at the better price.

50,525,ar,"Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. To find out how many eggs they produce in a week, we multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week:

\[
252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd makes in a week. Since one dozen contains 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs produced in a week by 12:

\[
\frac{1764 \text{ eggs/week}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens/week}
\]

Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 147 dozens of eggs in a week is:

\[
147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week}
\]

Thus, the amount Lloyd makes from selling eggs per week is:

82,525,ar,"To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we need to determine Alex's weight first.

Step 1: Identify Grace's weight.
Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Step 2: Determine Alex's weight.
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Therefore, we calculate Alex's weight as follows:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 478 \]

Step 3: Calculate their combined weights.
\[ \text{Combined weights} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]
\[ \text{Combined weights} = 125 + 478 \]
\[ \text{Combined weights} = 603 \]

Step 4: Write the final answer within a box.

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue for Thursday.**
- The mechanic charges $60 per truck tire and repaired 6 truck tires.
- Therefore, the revenue from truck tires on Thursday is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic charges $40 per car tire and repaired 4 car tires.
- Therefore, the revenue from car tires on Thursday is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- The total revenue for Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue for Friday.**
- Since the mechanic doesn't repair any truck tires on Friday, the revenue from truck tires is \(0\) dollars.
- The mechanic charges $40 per car tire and repaired 12 car tires.
- Therefore, the revenue from car tires on Friday is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.

3,541,ar,"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

First, let's find out how many meters James runs in one session. Since he runs 3 sprints per session and each sprint is 60 meters long, we can calculate the total distance in one session as follows:
\[
3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many sessions James runs in a week. Since he runs 3 times a week, the total number of sessions in a week is:
\[
3 \text{ sessions/week}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of meters James runs in a week by multiplying the distance in one session by the number of sessions in a week:
\[
180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
\]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:

1. **Initial Bill**: The initial bill is $40.00.

2. **Delivery Fee**: The delivery fee is 25% of the initial bill. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   0.25 \times 40 = 10
   \]
   Adding this fee to the initial bill gives us:
   \[
   40 + 10 = 50

3. **Additional Delivery Fee**: The additional delivery fee is $3.00. Adding this to the amount after the initial delivery fee, we get:
   \[
   50 + 3 = 53

4. **Tip**: The tip Stephen added is $4.00. Adding this to the amount after the additional delivery fee, we get:

63,557,ar,"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year:
- The streaming service charges $140 per month.
- The first half of the year is \(6\) months.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first half is \(140 \times 6 = 840\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the second half of the year:
- The streaming service charges 10% less for the second half.
- The second half of the year is also \(6\) months.
- Therefore, the cost for the second half is \(140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126\) dollars per month.
- The total cost for the second half is \(126 \times 6 = 756\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs from both halves to find the total amount",1596,0,

1. Calculate the total amount of money John has after selling his lego sets.
2. Determine how much money John spends on video games.
3. Subtract the amount spent on video games from the total money after selling the lego sets to find out how much money John has left.
4. Use the information that John has $5 left to find out how many lego sets he still has.

Let's start with the first step:

1. John sells 13 lego sets at $15 each.
   \[
   13 \times 15 = 195
   \]

2. John buys 8 video games at $20 each.
   \[
   8 \times 20 = 160
   \]

3. Subtract the amount spent on video games from the total money after selling the lego sets.
   \[
   195 - 160 = 35

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced in a week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced in a week. Since the chickens produce 252 eggs per day, in a week (7 days) they produce:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, we have:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Now, Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 147 dozens is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \]

28,573,ar,"Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. 

Let's break down the distance traveled by Henry:
- From the start to the first stop: 20 miles
- From the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles
- From the second stop to the end of the trip: 40 miles - 15 miles = 25 miles

To find how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we need to consider the distance from the start to the first stop and the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

The distance from the start to the first stop is already given as 20 miles.

The distance from the first stop to the second stop is 40 miles (as calculated above).

Adding these distances together gives us:
20 miles + 40 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, Henry traveled 60 miles between his first and second stops.

The final answer is:

1. **Cost of buying flowers in packages of 3:**
   - Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
   - To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
   - Total cost for 6 packages: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of buying flowers in packages of 2:**
   - Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
   - To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
   - Total cost for 9 packages: \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the total costs:
- Cost in packages of 3: $15
- Cost in packages of 2: $9

The savings is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

97,581,ar,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes used after cooking:**
   Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. When tomatoes are cooked, they lose half their volume. Therefore, the volume of tomatoes used before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   \[
   \text{Volume of tomatoes before cooking} = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of cans used:**
   Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume per can.
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64}{16} = 4
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of tomatoes used:**
   Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \times 3 = 12
   \]

12,597,ar,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to compare the total annual revenue from selling the lemons to the total annual cost of maintaining the tree.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- The tree grows 7 lemons each year.

\[ 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \]

Next, let's calculate the total annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.
- The tree costs $90 to plant.

\[ 3 + 90 = 93 \]

Now, we need to find the number of years \( t \) such that the total revenue from selling lemons equals the total cost of maintaining the tree.

\[ 10.5t = 93 \]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{93}{10.5} \]
\[ t = 9 \]

Therefore, it will take 9 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.",13,0,

\[
600 \times 12 = 7200
\]

Since she has been in the company for 5 years, her salary increases by 10% each year. Therefore, her annual salary after the first year will be:

\[
7200 \times 1.10 = 7920
\]

After the second year, her salary will be:

\[
7920 \times 1.10 = 8712
\]

After the third year, her salary will be:

\[
8712 \times 1.10 = 9593.20
\]

After the fourth year, her salary will be:

\[
9593.20 \times 1.10 = 10552.52

   - Given: Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - Therefore, the cost of a red tie is:
     \[
     40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of blue ties:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Therefore, the number of blue ties is:
     \[
     \frac{200}{40} = 5
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of red ties:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Therefore, the number of red ties is:
     \[

\[
\frac{20}{10} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling the candles. Each candle sells for $2.00, so for 20 candles, the revenue will be:

\[

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:

\[

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60

2. She can run at 6 miles per hour (since she runs 2 times faster than she skips).
3. She can walk at 1.5 miles per hour (since she runs 4 times faster than she walks).

4. Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
5. The time Dana spends running is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \) hours = 2 hours.
6. The time Dana spends walking is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \) hours = 4 hours.
7. The distance Dana runs in two hours is \( 6 \, \text{mile/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 12 \) miles.
8. The distance Dana walks in four hours is \( 1.5 \, \text{mile/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 6 \) miles.

9. Adding the distances she runs and walks, Dana travels a total of \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) miles.

44,637,ar,"First, we determine the number of pounds of beeswax required to make 20 candles. Since 10 candles can be made from one pound of beeswax:

\[
\text{Pounds of beeswax} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the supplies for these 2 pounds of beeswax. Since one pound costs $10.00:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Net profit} = 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

1. **Identify James's age:**
   James is given to be 10 years old.

2. **Determine Corey's age:**
   James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey's age is:
   \[
   \text{Corey's age} = \text{James's age} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]

3. **Determine Amy's age:**
   Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, Amy's age is:
   \[
   \text{Amy's age} = \text{Corey's age} - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

4. **Determine Jackson's age:**
   Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson's age is:
   \[
   \text{Jackson's age} = \text{Amy's age} - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4

Given:
- Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
- Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.

Let \( G \) be Gerald's original running time in seconds. Therefore,
\[
G - 2 = 38
\]
Solving for \( G \):
\[
G = 38 + 2 = 40
\]

So, Gerald's original running time is 40 seconds.

Next, Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement means his new running time is 90% of his original time.

To find Gerald's new running time:
\[
\text{New time} = 0.90 \times 40
\]
\[
\text{New time} = 36

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

1. **Total weight limit of the bridge:**
   The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.

2. **Weight of the driver and the empty truck:**
   The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

3. **Weight of the boxes:**

4. **Calculate the available weight for the boxes:**
   Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the total weight limit:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}

5. **Determine the maximum number of boxes:**
   Divide the available weight by the weight of each box:

1. **Initial Pension Calculation:**
   - Marcy works for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000.
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

2. **Year-by-Year Calculation:**
   - For the first 20 years, she receives an annual pension of $50,000.
   - For the next 10 years (from year 21 to year 30), she receives 5% of the pension value.

3. **Annual Pension Calculation for the Last 10 Years:**
   - The initial pension value is $50,000.

   - 40% of the download is 200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB.
   - The download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the download time for 80 GB is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

2. Add the download time for the remaining 60% of the file:
   - The total download time for 60% of the file after the restart is 40 minutes.

3. Finally, add the download time for the first 40% and the time of the restart:
   - The time for the restart is 20 minutes.
   - Total download time = 40 minutes (first 40%) + 20 minutes (restart) = 60 minutes.",160,0,

9,653,ar,"Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of $1.2 times her regular hourly rate. First, calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, determine the overtime hours worked:
\[ 45 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate her overtime pay rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Calculate her earnings for the overtime hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, add her earnings from the first 40 hours and the overtime hours to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Thus, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(460\).",460,0,

1. Identify Grace's weight.
2. Calculate Alex's weight based on the given relationship.
3. Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight to find their combined weight.

1. Grace's weight is 125 pounds.
2. Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. Therefore, we calculate Alex's weight as follows:
   \[
   \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 = 4 \times 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Now, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight to find their combined weight:
   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} = 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds}

Thus, the combined weights of Grace and Alex in pounds is \(623\).",623,0,

\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} \]
\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} \]
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can determine the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:
\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{5} \]
\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the original purchase price from the new value.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increase the value of the house by 150%. We start with the original purchase price of $80,000.

\[
\text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
\]

So, the new value of the house after the repairs is $120,000.

Next, we subtract the original purchase price from the new value to find the profit.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Original purchase price} = 120,000 - 80,000 = 40,000
\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:

62,677,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we need to consider the conditions given in the problem.

1. If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000 per year.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she has not worked for the full 40 years, she does not qualify for the $50,000 annual pension.

However, she has worked for 20 years, which qualifies her for the 5% annual pension. To calculate her annual pension, we need to know the total value of her pension, which is not provided in the problem. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact annual pension without this information.

Given the information, we can only conclude that her annual pension will be 5% of the total pension value. Since the problem does not provide the total pension value, we cannot calculate the exact amount.

Thus, the final numeric result is:

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
- Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the number of eggs she eats in one week is:
  \[
  3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}
  \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
- She eats 21 eggs per week.
- Over 4 weeks, the total number of eggs is:
  \[
  21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times faster than her walking speed, her walking speed is:

\[ \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Therefore, the time she spends running is:

\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

The time she spends walking is:

\[ \frac{6 \times 2}{3} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

1. **Determine Alex's weight:**
   - We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds.
   - Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.
   - First, calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
     \[
     4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds}

2. **Calculate the combined weight of Grace and Alex:**
   - Grace's weight is 125 pounds.
   - Alex's weight is 498 pounds.
   - Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings from teaching = 20 \times 35 = 700\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from cheerleading coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings from cheerleading coaching = \(30 \times 15 = 450\) dollars.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings from teaching + Weekly earnings from cheerleading coaching
- Total weekly earnings = \(700 + 450 = 1150\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate her annual salary:

2. Since she can skip at half the rate she can run, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.
3. Since she runs at four times the rate she walks, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.
4. Dana spends one-third of the time running, so she spends \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours running.
5. Dana spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she spends \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours walking.
6. The distance she runs is her running speed multiplied by the time spent running, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.
7. The distance she walks is her walking speed multiplied by the time spent walking, which is \(1.5 \times 4 = 6\) miles.
8. The total distance she travels is the sum of the distances she runs and walks, which is \(12 + 6 = 18\) miles.

First, let's determine the number of blue ties John bought:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of one red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, we have:
\[
\text{Cost of one red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the ties:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the weekly number of eggs into dozens.
3. Compute the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Finally, we compute the weekly revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so the total revenue is:

Next, we calculate the monthly installment amount. Since the total cost is spread over 3 months, we divide 750 by 3:

\[

\]

Each month, Shiela will pay the principal amount of the installment plus the interest. The interest rate is 2%, so we need to calculate 2% of $250:

\[
0.02 \times 250 = 5

Adding the interest to the principal amount gives the total payment for each month:

   - Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Therefore, David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.

2. **Determine the amount of laundry Raymond does:**

Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 18:

Allen's current age is 99 years. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[
99 + 10 = 109
\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

   Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and this is half her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

2. Determine Dana's walking speed:
   Dana's running speed is four times faster than her walking speed, so her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

3. Calculate the time spent running:
   Dana spends one-third of the time running, so she spends (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours running.

4. Calculate the time spent walking:
   Dana spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she spends (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours walking.

5. Calculate the distance traveled:
   Distance while running = running speed * time = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
   Distance while walking = walking speed * time = 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles
   Total distance = 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles

2. We know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep that Charleston has is:
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times S = 4 \times 20 = 80

3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep that Toulouse has is:
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. To find the total number of sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add the number of sheep each city has:
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, we sum the costs together:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes used at work.
2. Determine the total number of Post-it notes she had initially.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes purchased from the total number of Post-it notes used.

First, we know Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee and had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes used at work is:

\[ 220 - 23 = 197 \]

Next, we know she initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. The total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package is:

\[ 80 + x = 197 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 197 - 80 = 117 \]

2. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
   \[

3. The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie, which is $40.

58,749,ar,"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to add all the additional fees and tips to the original total bill. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Original Total Bill**:
   The final bill is $40.00.

2. **Delivery Fee**:
   The delivery fee is 25% of the original total.
   \[
   \text{Delivery Fee} = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
   \]

3. **Additional Delivery Fees**:
   The additional delivery fee is $3.00.
   \[
   \text{Total Delivery Fees} = 10.00 + 3.00 = 13.00
   \]

4. **Tip**:
   The tip is $4.00.
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 40.00 + 13.00 + 4.00 = 57.00
   \]

Thus, the final price of Stephen's groceries is \(57.00\).",57,0,

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the cost for the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]
So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]
So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Finally, we sum up all the costs:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694

   - First segment: 4 miles
   - Second segment: 2 miles
   - Total distance walked so far: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles

2. Determine the total time taken to walk these 6 miles.
   - First segment: 1 hour
   - Second segment: 1 hour
   - Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. Calculate the required total time for her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.
   - Average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

4. Calculate the remaining distance she needs to walk.
   - Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

5. Calculate the required speed to walk the remaining 6 miles in 3 hours.
   - Required speed = 6 miles / 3 hours = 2 miles per hour

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 2 miles per hour.",6,0,

First, let's find out the guesses of the three friends:

- The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend says \(\frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60\) jelly beans.
- The third friend says \(80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100\) jelly beans.

Next, we sum these guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Finally, we divide the total sum by the number of friends (which is 3) to find the average guess:
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

Therefore, the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar is \(80\).",80,0,

\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we calculate the number of red ties John bought. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10
\]

We also know that each red tie costs 50% more than each blue tie. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the costs of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent:

\[
200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

62,765,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we need to understand the structure of her pension benefits based on her work experience.

1. **Full Pension**: If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets a full annual pension of $50,000.
2. **Reduced Pension**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, her pension benefit will be reduced. The reduced pension is calculated as 5% of the full pension amount.

Let's calculate the reduced pension:
\[
\text{Reduced Pension} = 5\% \text{ of } 50,000
\]
\[
\text{Reduced Pension} = \frac{5}{100} \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500

93,773,ar,"First, we need to find out Gerald's original running time for the 400-meter hurdles. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and that Lee used to be able to run two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[
\text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we need to determine Gerald's new time after his diet improvement. The diet improvement increased Gerald's speed by 10%. To find the new time, we calculate 10% of Gerald's original time and subtract it from the original time:

\[
\text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - 0.10 \times \text{Gerald's original time} = 40 - 0.10 \times 40 = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.",36,0,

   - On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
   - On Tuesday, she wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday.
     \[
     5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}

**Step 1: Calculate Jill's weekly earnings from teaching.**
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings from teaching = $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

**Step 2: Calculate Jill's weekly earnings from cheerleading coaching.**
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings from cheerleading = $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

**Step 3: Calculate Jill's total weekly earnings.**
- Total weekly earnings = weekly earnings from teaching + weekly earnings from cheerleading
- Total weekly earnings = $700 + $450 = $1150/week

**Step 4: Calculate Jill's annual earnings.**
- Annual earnings = total weekly earnings * number of weeks per year
- Annual earnings = $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $5750",57500,0,

1. Identify Grace's weight.
2. Calculate Alex's weight based on the given relationship.
3. Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight to get the combined weight.

**Step 1: Identify Grace's weight.**
Grace weighs 125 pounds.

**Step 2: Calculate Alex's weight.**
We know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. First, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds} \]
Then, we subtract 2 pounds from this result to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight to get the combined weight.**
Now, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, their combined weights in pounds are \(623\).",623,0,

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
2. According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins can be expressed as \( G = S + 30 \).
3. The total number of coins is given as 110. This can be written as \( S + G = 110 \).
4. Substitute the expression for \( G \) from the second equation into the third equation: \( S + (S + 30) = 110 \).
5. Combine like terms: \( 2S + 30 = 110 \).
6. Subtract 30 from both sides: \( 2S = 80 \).
7. Divide both sides by 2: \( S = 40 \).
8. The number of gold coins is \( G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \).

First, let's calculate the number of meters James runs in one session:
- James runs 3 sprints each session.
- Each sprint is 60 meters long.
- Therefore, the number of meters in one session is:
  \[
  3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ meters}
  \]

Next, let's determine how many sessions James runs in a week:
- James runs 3 times a week.
- Therefore, the total number of sessions in a week is:
  \[
  3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ sessions}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total number of meters James runs in a week by multiplying the number of meters in one session by the number of sessions in a week:
\[
180 \times 9 = 1620 \text{ meters}
\]

Thus, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Dana's running speed is twice her skipping speed, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.
- Dana's running speed is also four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the total time Dana spends running and walking.
- She spends one-third of the time running, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
- She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.
- Distance run = \(6\) miles/hour \(\times\) 2 hours = 12 miles.
- Distance walked = \(1.5\) miles/hour \(\times\) 4 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance traveled is \(12 + 6 = 18\) miles.",18,0,

First, we know the total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. This means the weight of the truck when filled with boxes is:

\[ 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box:

\[ \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} \]

Calculating this, we get:

\[ 83.3333 \]

Since we cannot load a fraction of a box, we take the integer part of this division:

\[ 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is \(83\)",83,0,

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday. This means:

- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:

2. Subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid to find the total cost of the pizza boxes.
3. Divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box to find the number of boxes ordered.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.**

- Cost of the chicken meal: $12
- Cost of 5 packs of milk: \(5 \times 3 = 15\)
- Cost of 4 apples: \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\)

Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples:

1. Calculate the total weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.
3. Divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box to find the maximum number of boxes.

Step 1: The bridge can carry a maximum weight of 5000 pounds.

Step 2: The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight that can be carried by the boxes is:
\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 3: Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box:
\[ 1245 \div 15 = 83 \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is \( \boxed{} 83.",83,0,

1. Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars have driven through, so the number of cars remaining is \( 30 - x \).
3. After the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through, making the total number of cars now \( (30 - x) + 20 = 50 - x \).
4. 5 cars take an exit, so the final number of cars on the motorway is \( (50 - x) - 5 = 45 - x \).

We are given that there are still 30 cars on the motorway. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 45 - x = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):

Now, subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:

- Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed.
- Wendi has 20 chickens.

Total feed needed = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups.

Next, we subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount needed:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.

Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

Finally, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

2. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
3. After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drive through, so the number of cars left is \( 30 - x \).
4. In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through, so the number of cars after the remaining 15 minutes is \( 30 - x + 20 = 50 - x \).
5. 5 cars take an exit, so the number of cars left is \( 50 - x - 5 = 45 - x \).
6. We know that after all these events, there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, so \( 45 - x = 30 \).
7. Solving for \( x \), we get \( 45 - 30 = x \), which simplifies to \( x = 15 \).

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(15\).",5,0,

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has before giving any away.
2. Determine how many potted plants Mary will give away.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has:
- She received 18 new potted plants.
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the total number of potted plants initially is \( 18 + 2 \times 40 = 18 + 80 = 98 \).

Next, let's determine how many potted plants Mary will give away:
- She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the number of potted plants given away is \( 40 \).

Finally, we subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants:

- She took 1 hour for the first 4 miles.
- She took 1 hour for the next 2 miles.

Thus, the total time spent is:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out the remaining distance Marissa needs to hike. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. She has already walked:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire trail. To achieve this, she needs to complete the remaining 6 miles in 2 hours. Let \( v \) be the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance. Then,
\[ v = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} \]
\[ v = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \]

   - Therefore, for 20 pounds, the cost is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle sells for $2.00.
   - Therefore, for 20 candles, the revenue is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Total cost = $200.00
   - Total revenue = $40.00
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = \(40 - 200 = -160\) dollars.

17,901,ar,"To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and cheerleading coaching separately, then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.
\[
\text{Teaching earnings} = 20 \times 35 \times 50 = 35000
\]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from cheerleading:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.
\[
\text{Cheerleading earnings} = 30 \times 15 \times 50 = 22500
\]

Finally, we sum her earnings from both teaching and cheerleading to find her annual salary:
\[
\text{Annual salary} = 35000 + 22500 = 57500
\]

Thus, the final numeric result is:

First, calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days:

Next, calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 180 days:

Now, add the amounts from both periods to find the total consumption:

According to the problem, the number of games the team won is 8 more than the number of games they lost. Therefore, the number of games won can be expressed as \( l + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost. We know the total number of games played is 22. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

\[ l + (l + 8) = 22 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[ 2l + 8 = 22 \]

2. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[ 2l = 14 \]

3. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ l = 7 \]

So, the number of games lost is 7. Therefore, the number of games won is:

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   Add the number of sheep from all three cities.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep that all three cities have together is \(260\).",260,0,

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs from eggs to dozens.

1. Claire eats 3 eggs every day for breakfast. There are 7 days in a week.
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]

2. To find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of eggs per week by 4.
   \[
   21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to convert it to dozens.
   \[
   \frac{84}{12} = 7 \text{ dozens}

1. Calculate the combined weight of the boxes after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.
2. Determine how many boxes can fit into this weight, given that each box weighs 15 pounds.

First, we know the bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds. The driver and the empty truck together weigh 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight that the boxes can have is:

\[ 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} = 83 \text{ boxes} \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is \(83\).",83,0,

19,933,ar,"First, let's determine how far Marissa has walked so far and how much distance she has left to walk.

Marissa has walked:
- 4 miles in 1 hour
- 2 miles in the next 1 hour

Total distance walked: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
Total time taken: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Marissa wants her average speed for the entire trail to be 4 miles per hour. To find the total time required for the entire trail at this average speed, we use the formula:
Total time / Total distance = Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed required to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

2. Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of heels.
3. Let \( B \) be the cost of the boots. According to the problem, the total cost of the heels is five dollars less than the boots.
4. Formulate the equation based on the given information and solve for \( B \).

1. One pair of heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.
4. According to the problem, the total cost of the heels is five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation: \( 99 = B - 5 \).
5. Solve for \( B \): \( 99 + 5 = B \), which gives us \( B = 104 \).

1. Calculate each friend's guess.
2. Sum the guesses.
3. Divide the sum by the number of friends.

Let's start with the first friend:
- The first friend says 80.

Next, the second friend:
- The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend's guess is 40 + 20 = 60.

Finally, the third friend:
- The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend's guess is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we sum the guesses:
- 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

Finally, we divide the sum by the number of friends:
- The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

18,949,ar,"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
2. Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire eats in one week. She makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we convert 84 eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen:
\[ 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[7 \text{ dozens}",7,0,

50,965,ar,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced in a week.
2. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find the total number of eggs produced in a week. Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so:

\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = \boxed{294 \text{ dollars/week}} \]",294,0,

1. **Cindy's pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's pets:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Jan's pets:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Total number of pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total pets} = \text{Jan's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Cindy's pets} = 18 + 6 + 4 = 28

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   According to the problem, there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   The combined number of dogs and cats is the sum of the number of dogs and the number of cats:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:

1. **Calculate the cost of supplies for 20 candles:**
   - Each candle requires one pound of beeswax and wicks, which costs $10.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue:
     \[
     40 - 200 = -160 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Since the net profit is negative, it indicates a loss. The final numeric result is:

Next, calculate the time it takes to download the first part of the file:
\[
\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}

Now, calculate how much of the file remains to be downloaded:

Then, calculate the time it takes to download the remaining part of the file:

Add the time for the restart to the total download time:

19,1005,ar,"To find the required speed, we first calculate the total distance Marissa needs to cover and the total time she has for the remaining distance.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. She has already walked 4 miles and 2 miles, so the remaining distance is:
\[ 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Marissa's average speed over the entire trail should be 4 miles per hour. Let \( t \) be the total time she has for the remaining 6 miles. The total time spent so far is:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

The average speed equation is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{t} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles is \( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \) miles per hour.

47,1005,ar,"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of all the ties:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 40 + 10 \times 60 = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

\[
\boxed{800

68,1005,ar,"To determine the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of girls**: We are given that there are 60 girls.

2. **Calculate the number of boys**: Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of students**: We add the number of girls and boys to get the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of teachers**: We know that there are 5 students to every teacher. Therefore, we divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers:
   \[
   \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36
   \]

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36",36,0,

67,1021,ar,"To determine the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Number of diamonds**:
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Number of rubies**:
   - The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Number of emeralds**:
   - The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

4. **Total number of gems**:
   - The total number of gems is the sum of the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.
   - Therefore, the total number of gems is:
     \[
     175 + 140 + 280 = 595
