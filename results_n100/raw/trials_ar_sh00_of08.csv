1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   \[
   \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

4. **Total gems:**
   - The total number of gems is the sum of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.
   \[
   \text{Total gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595

2. **Marcia's pets:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.

4. **Total pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28

1. Start with the total number of cars originally on the motorway.
2. Add the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.
3. Add the number of cars that took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
4. Subtract the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes to find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Original number of cars: 30
2. Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: 20
3. Cars that took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam: 5
4. Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes: 30 - 20 - 5

Perform the subtraction:

1. She walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour.
2. She walked the next 2 miles in another 1 hour.

The total distance she has walked is \(4 + 2 = 6\) miles, and the total time she has spent is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

The remaining distance she needs to walk is \(12 - 6 = 6\) miles.

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail, she needs to complete the trail in \(4 \times 12 = 48\) hours.

She has already spent 2 hours, so she has \(48 - 2 = 46\) hours left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6}{46} \]

So, the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance is \(\boxed{\frac{6}{46}}\).",6,0,

Next, calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink.
\[

Calculate the total amount of water before spilling any.
\[
\text{Total water before spill} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters}

Finally, calculate the amount of water after spilling one liter of the orange drink.
\[
\text{Water after spill} = \frac{47}{3} - 1 = \frac{47}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{44}{3} \text{ liters}

3. Find the total number of hours spent writing over the three days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.**
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, she wrote:
\[ 5 \times \frac{2}{5} = 2 \text{ articles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday.**
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, she wrote:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ articles} \]

**Step 3: Find the total number of hours spent writing over the three days.**
Each article takes 4 hours to write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing is:
\[ 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 \]

43,40,ar,"First, let's determine the total calorie content of the 300g bag of chips. Given that there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving contains 250 calories, we calculate:

\[
5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories}
\]

Next, we know that the daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[
2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

Since the total calorie content of the 300g bag of chips is 1250 calories, we can now determine how many grams you can eat without exceeding the remaining 200 calories. The weight of the bag is 300g, and we cannot eat more than this without exceeding the remaining calorie limit.

Thus, the number of grams you can eat is:

\[
300 \text{ grams}

93,40,ar,"First, we need to determine Gerald's original running time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, we can express this relationship as:

\[ \text{Lee's original time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - 2 \]
\[ 38 = \text{Gerald's original time} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 40 \]

Next, we know that Gerald's new time after changing his diet will be 10% faster than his original time. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 + 0.10 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 44 \]

63,48,ar,"The streaming service charges Aleena $140 per month for the first half of the year. The first half of the year consists of 6 months.

\[
\text{Total cost for the first half} = \$140 \times 6 = \$840
\]

The second half of the year consists of 6 months, but the monthly charge is reduced by 10%.

First, calculate 10% of $140:

\[
10\% \text{ of } \$140 = \$140 \times 0.10 = \$14
\]

So, the monthly charge for the second half is:

\[
\$140 - \$14 = \$126
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for the second half} = \$126 \times 6 = \$756
\]

Finally, add the total costs for both halves to find the total payment for the year:

\[
\text{Total payment} = \$840 + \$756 = \$1596

63,64,ar,"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the payments for the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month for the first 6 months.
   - Total cost for the first half: \(140 \times 6 = 840\) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges 10% less than the initial amount for the remaining 6 months.
   - 10% of $140: \(0.10 \times 140 = 14\) dollars.
   - Reduced monthly charge: \(140 - 14 = 126\) dollars.
   - Total cost for the second half: \(126 \times 6 = 756\) dollars.

3. **Total Payment for the Year:**
   - Total payment: \(840 + 756 = 1596\) dollars.

1. **Cindy's Pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's Pets:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Jan's Pets:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

Now, we sum the number of pets each person has:
\[
\text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
\]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes used.
2. Add the remaining Post-it notes to the used Post-it notes to find the total number of Post-it notes she had at the end.
3. Subtract the initial number of Post-it notes she had from the total number of Post-it notes she had at the end to find the number of Post-it notes in the package.

First, let's calculate the total number of Post-it notes used:
\[ \text{Total Post-it notes used} = 220 \]

Next, add the remaining Post-it notes to the used Post-it notes:
\[ \text{Total Post-it notes at the end} = 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Finally, subtract the initial number of Post-it notes from the total number of Post-it notes at the end:
\[ \text{Post-it notes in the package} = 243 - 80 = 163 \]

The time is 3 hours, and the speed is 10 miles per hour.

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Tom to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, covering the same distance.

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

91,88,ar,"To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we will follow the information given step by step.

1. **Cindy's Pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's Pets:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Jan's Pets:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of pets each person has:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
\]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is \(28\).",28,0,

1. **Calculate the monthly charge:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.

2. **Calculate the cost for the first half of the year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so half of the year is 6 months.
   - Total cost for the first half of the year = $140 * 6 = $840.

3. **Calculate the cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The streaming company charges 10% less money for the second half of the year.
   - 10% of $140 is $140 * 0.10 = $14.
   - Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
   - Total cost for the second half of the year = $126 * 6 = $756.

4. **Calculate the total amount paid in the year:**

98,96,ar,"To determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of cars on the motorway:**
   There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that took an exit:**
   5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

3. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:**
   20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

4. **Total cars that drove through:**
   The total number of cars that drove through is the difference between the initial number of cars and the number of cars that took an exit.
   Total cars that drove through = 30 - 5 = 25.

5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes:**
   Since 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:
   \[
   25 - 20 = 5

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know \( S = 40 \), substitute this value back into the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(70\).",70,0,

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of ties} = 200 + 10 \times 60 = 200 + 600 = 800

1. **Initial pension for 40 years:**
   - Marcy's annual pension for 40 years is $50,000.

2. **Pension for the remaining years after 20 years:**
   - After working for 20 years, Marcy has \(30 - 20 = 10\) years left.
   - For these remaining years, she receives 5% of her annual pension.
   - Therefore, her annual pension for these 10 years is \(0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500\).

3. **Total annual pension after 30 years:**
   - The total annual pension is the sum of the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years.

1. **Calculate the number of cats:**
   - Given that there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

2. **Calculate the combined number of pets (dogs and cats):**
   - The number of rabbits is given as twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

The original price of the jewelry is $5,000.
The increase in price is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * 5000 = $125.
So, the new price of the jewelry is $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.
The profit from selling the jewelry is $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.

Now, let's calculate the profit for the electronic gadgets if the market goes up by 1.2%.
The original price of the electronic gadgets is $8,000.
The increase in price is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * 8000 = $96.

1. **Day 1:**
   - Both trains travel westward and cover 80 miles.
   - Since they are traveling in the same direction, they will end up at the same point as they started.
   - Therefore, the distance covered by each train on Day 1 is 0 miles.

2. **Day 2:**
   - Both trains travel northward and cover 150 miles.
   - Since they are traveling in opposite directions, they will be 150 miles apart.
   - The distance covered by each train on Day 2 is 150 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered by Each Train:**
   - Total distance covered by each train = distance covered on Day 1 + distance covered on Day 2
   - Total distance covered by each train = 0 miles (Day 1) + 150 miles (Day 2) = 150 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 150.",230,0,

\[ 6 \times 140 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the second half of the year. The streaming company charges 10% less than the initial amount for the second half. To find the reduced amount, we calculate 10% of $140:

\[ 140 \times 0.10 = 140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, the cost for the second half of the year (6 months) is:

\[ 6 \times 126 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount paid for the entire year is the sum of the first half and the second half:

Next, we need to find out how many miles she has left to walk. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left.

Now, let's determine the total time she has already spent walking. She spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another hour walking the next 2 miles, so she has spent 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

To maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire trail, she needs to complete the remaining 6 miles in 2 - 2 = 0 hours. This means she needs to walk all 6 miles in 0 hours, which is not possible. Therefore, it is impossible for her to walk the remaining distance at a constant speed to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire trail.

So, there are 90 occupied units.

Finally, subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:

1. **Marigolds:**
   - Price per pot: $2.74
   - Number of pots: 12
   - Total revenue from marigolds: \(2.74 \times 12 = 32.88\)

2. **Petunias:**
   - Price per pot: $1.87
   - Number of pots: 9
   - Total revenue from petunias: \(1.87 \times 9 = 16.83\)

3. **Begonias:**
   - Price per pot: $2.12
   - Number of pots: 17
   - Total revenue from begonias: \(2.12 \times 17 = 36.04\)

Now, we sum the revenues from all three types of flowers:

Step 1: Identify the number of pets Cindy has.
Cindy has 4 pets.

Step 2: Determine the number of pets Marcia has.
Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
\[ \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = \text{Number of pets Cindy has} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Step 3: Determine the number of pets Jan has.
Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
\[ \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pets.
Add the number of pets each person has.
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of pets Cindy has} + \text{Number of pets Marcia has} + \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 4 + 6 + 18 = \]",28,0,

35,160,ar,"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to break down his scores into two parts: points scored in the first 20 minutes and points scored in the second 20 minutes.

First, we know that Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate his score in the second 20 minutes. The problem states that he scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes.

To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, Mike scores 1 more point in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, his score in the second 20 minutes is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes to the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Thus, Mike scored a total of

1. **Understand the volume reduction**: When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is twice the volume of the original cans.

2. **Calculate the volume of the original cans**: Since the sauce makes 32 ounces and this is twice the volume of the original cans, we divide the volume of the sauce by 2:
   \[
   \text{Volume of original cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{2} = 16 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of original cans**: Since each original can contains 16 ounces, we know Freda used exactly one original can.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Each original can contains three tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 1 \text{ original can} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 3 \text{ tomatoes}

The puppy then consumes 2 cups of dog food every day for the next 180 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 360 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total consumption in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required. Since one bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups by the cups per bag:
\[ 540 \text{ cups} \div 110 \text{ cups/bag} = \boxed{5 \text{ bags}} \]",5,0,

2. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.
3. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.

First, calculate the number of blue ties John bought:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, calculate the number of red ties John bought:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, calculate the cost of each red tie:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Next, calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, calculate the total amount spent on ties:

1. **Total number of cars originally on the motorway:**
   \[

2. **Cars that took an exit:**
   \[
   5
   \]

3. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:**

First, we subtract the number of cars that took an exit from the total number of cars:
\[
30 - 5 = 25
\]
So, 25 cars were left to drive through the traffic jam.

Next, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the remaining cars:
\[
25 - 20 = 5

29,192,ar,"To determine the cost of the boots, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the two pairs of high heels:**
   - One pair of heels costs $33.
   - The other pair costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:**
   - Total cost of the two pairs of heels = cost of the first pair + cost of the second pair
   - Total cost = 33 + 66 = 99 dollars

3. **Relate the total cost of the heels to the cost of the boots:**
   - According to the problem, the total cost of the heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots.
   - Let \( B \) be the cost of the boots.
   - Therefore, \( 99 = B - 5 \).

4. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - \( 99 + 5 = B \)
   - \( B = 104 \) dollars

1. Calculate the weight of 30 comic books:
   Each comic book weighs \frac{1}{4} pound, so:
   \[
   30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Determine the remaining weight to be removed:
   Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight is:
   \[
   15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of toys needed to remove the remaining weight:
   Each toy weighs \frac{1}{2} pound, so the number of toys needed to remove 7.5 pounds is:
   \[
   7.5 \times \frac{1}{2} = 15 \text{ toys}

   - The bridge can carry 5000 pounds.
   - The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

1. Calculate the total weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit to find the remaining weight.
3. Divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes.

Given:
- The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.
- The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
- Each box weighs 15 pounds.

First, we find the remaining weight that the bridge can carry:
\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we divide this remaining weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes:
\[ 1245 \div 15 = 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is \(83\).",83,0,

1. **Determine the number of dogs:**
   Given that there are 60 dogs.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   According to the problem, there are two cats for every dog.
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats}) - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   \[

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the javelin when not holding the gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
3. Determine the difference between the distance when holding the gemstone and the reach of the dragon's flames.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin for 400 feet when not holding the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone is:
\[ 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance when holding the gemstone:
\[ 1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet} \]",200,0,

2. Determine the number of calories per serving.
3. Calculate the remaining calories allowed based on the daily calorie target and the calories already consumed.
4. Convert the remaining calories into grams.

1. A 300g bag has 5 servings.
2. Each serving contains 250 calories.
3. The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
   \[
   2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories remaining}
   \]
4. Since each serving contains 250 calories, the number of servings you can eat is:
   \[
   \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings}
   \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat is:
\[
0.8 \times 5 = 4 \text{ grams}

1. **First Instance:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second Instance:**
   - The alarm rang for three times as long as the first time.
   - Since the first time it rang for 4 rings, the second time it rang for \(3 \times 4 = 12\) rings.

3. **Third Instance:**
   - The alarm rang for half as long as the second time.
   - Since the second time it rang for 12 rings, the third time it rang for \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) rings.

Now, we sum up the number of rings from all three instances:

- First instance: 4 rings

- Third instance: 6 rings

Total number of rings = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22

11,232,ar,"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, we know that Claire eats 3 eggs each day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide 84 by 12:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.",7,0,

2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced in a week.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs produced per week. Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day, and there are 7 days in a week:

\[
252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}

Next, we determine how many dozens of eggs are produced in a week. There are 12 eggs in a dozen:

\[
\frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12} = 147 \text{ dozens/week}

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has before giving any away.
2. Determine the number of potted plants she will give away.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has:

Next, let's determine how many potted plants she will give away:
- She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge, and she has 40 ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons.
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total annual cost:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
- The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
- Therefore, the total annual cost is \(90 + 3 = 93\) dollars.

To find out how many years it will take for the annual revenue to equal the total annual cost, we divide the total annual cost by the annual revenue:
\[
\frac{93}{10.5} = 9.08
\]

Thus, it will take approximately 9 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the building is occupied, we calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

So, there are 90 occupied units.

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:

\[
120 - 90 = 30
\]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[
\boxed{30",30,0,

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.

So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330

First, let's find out how many articles she wrote each day:
- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday.
  \[
  5 \times \frac{2}{5} + 5 = 5 \times \frac{2}{5} + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 \text{ articles}

- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

Next, we sum up the number of articles written over the three days:
\[
5 + 7 + 14 = 26

1. Calculate the daily time John spends on all his dogs.
2. Calculate the weekly time John spends on all his dogs.

First, let's calculate the daily time John spends on all his dogs. Since John takes care of 10 dogs and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, we can find the total daily time by multiplying the number of dogs by the time each dog takes:

\[
10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the weekly time John spends on all his dogs. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week:

\[
5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week is:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Since Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day, in a week (7 days), they produce:

\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so:

\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]",294,0,

67,272,ar,"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Number of Diamonds:**
   There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Number of Rubies:**
   Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, we calculate the number of rubies as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Number of Emeralds:**
   There are twice the number of emeralds than rubies. Therefore, we calculate the number of emeralds as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

4. **Total Number of Gems:**
   To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:
   \[
   175 + 140 + 280 = 595

1. **First Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the second month is three times the downloads in the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \(3 \times 60 = 180\).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   - To find the number of downloads in the third month, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180.
   - 30% of 180 is \(0.30 \times 180 = 54\).
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is \(180 - 54 = 126\).

Finally, we sum up the downloads from all three months:

\[60 + 180 + 126 = 366.\]",366,0,

1. **Initial Bill**: Stephen's final bill is $40.00.

2. **Delivery Fee**: The delivery vendor adds a 25% fee to the bill. To find the fee amount, we calculate:
   \[
   0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
   \]
   Adding this to the initial bill, we get:
   \[
   40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00
   \]

3. **Delivery Fees**: The delivery vendor charges $3.00 in delivery fees. Adding this to the total, we get:
   \[
   50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00
   \]

4. **Tip**: Stephen adds a $4.00 tip. Adding this to the current total, we get:

2. Let \( t \) be the time it takes for Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles.
3. Therefore, \( t + 2 = 38 \).
4. Solving for \( t \):
   \[
   t = 38 - 2 = 36 \text{ seconds}
   \]
5. Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%.
6. A 10% improvement in speed means Gerald's new time is 90% of his original time.
7. Therefore, the new time it takes for Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles is \( 0.9 \times 36 \).
8. Calculating this:
   \[
   \text{New time} = 0.9 \times 36 = 32.4 \text{ seconds}

Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 32.4 seconds.

1. **Cost for the material:**
   Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch.

2. **Cost for the jeweler:**
   Janet pays $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Insurance cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost for insurance. First, we calculate the total cost of the material and the jeweler:

   \]
   The insurance cost is:
   \[

1. Determine the distance each train travels on the first day.
2. Determine the distance each train travels on the second day.
3. Add the distances covered on both days to get the total distance traveled by each train.

First, we know that each train travels west for 80 miles. So, the distance traveled by each train on the first day is:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that each train travels north for 150 miles. So, the distance traveled by each train on the second day is:
\[ 150 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances covered on both days to get the total distance traveled by each train in the two days:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{230 \text{ miles}} \]",230,0,

97,312,ar,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes used:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When tomatoes are cooked into sauce, they lose half their volume.
   - Therefore, the volume of tomatoes used is twice the volume of the sauce.

   \[
   \text{Volume of tomatoes used} = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can of tomatoes weighs 16 ounces.
   - To find the number of cans used, divide the total volume of tomatoes by the weight of each can.

   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64}{16} = 4
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \times 3 = 12
   \]

John sells 13 lego sets at $15 each.
\[
13 \times 15 = 195
\]

Next, let's calculate how much money John spends on video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each.
\[
8 \times 20 = 160
\]

He also has $5 left after his purchases. Therefore, the total money he had is:
\[
195 - 160 + 5 = 40
\]

Since he spent all of this money, he must have started with:
\[
195 - 160 + 5 = 40
\]

This means he had $40 before spending any money left over. He sold all his lego sets and spent $160 on video games, which means he had $40 initially. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[
0
\]

Thus, the number of lego sets John still has is:

1. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
2. Determine how much farther the javelin can be thrown with the gemstone compared to without it.
3. Find the difference between the distance with the gemstone and the reach of the dragon's flames.

1. Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
2. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The difference between the distance with the gemstone and the reach of the dragon's flames is:
   \[
   1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet}

2. Determine how many packs of 4 yogurts are needed to cover 60 yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost of the yogurt packs.

1. Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he eats:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ yogurts}
   \]

2. To find out how many packs of 4 yogurts are needed, we divide the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per pack:
   \[
   \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ packs}
   \]

3. Each pack of 4 yogurts costs $5.00. Therefore, the total cost for 15 packs is:

1. Calculate the cost of supplies for 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the net profit.

First, let's calculate the cost of supplies for 20 candles. Since each candle requires 1 pound of beeswax and wicks, and each pound costs $10.00, the cost of supplies for 20 candles is:

\[ 20 \times 10 = 200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle sells for $2.00, so the total revenue is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Now, let's find the net profit by subtracting the cost of supplies from the total revenue:

\[ 40 - 200 = -160 \]

Since the net profit is negative, it means Charlie's business is losing money. Therefore, the final answer is:

Given:
- John spent $200 on blue ties.
- Each blue tie costs $40.

Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 per tie = 5 ties.

Next, we determine the cost of each red tie.

Given:
- Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie.
- Each blue tie costs $40.

Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60 per tie.

Now, we calculate the total cost of all red ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties = 2 * 5 = 10 ties.

Total cost of red ties = 10 ties * $60 per tie = $600.

Finally, we find the total amount spent on all ties.

Total cost of all ties = Total cost of blue ties + Total cost of red ties = $200 + $600 = $800.",800,0,

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, calculate the remaining weight to be removed. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds from the comic books:
\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, let \( x \) be the number of toys he needs to remove. Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, so the total weight of \( x \) toys is:
\[
x \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

The total number of students is 200, and 2/5 of them are boys:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80

1. **Calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:**
   - Each lemon sells for $1.5.
   - The tree grows 7 lemons each year.
   - Annual revenue = $1.5 * 7 = $10.50.

2. **Calculate the annual expenses:**
   - Annual cost to water and feed the tree = $3.

3. **Calculate the net annual income:**
   - Net annual income = Annual revenue - Annual expenses
   - Net annual income = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

4. **Determine how many years it will take for the net income to cover the initial cost:**
   - Initial cost = $90
   - Net annual income = $7.50
   - Number of years = Initial cost / Net annual income
   - Number of years = $90 / $7.50 = 12

1. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can skip at a speed of 3 miles per hour.
   - She can run at a rate of speed that is four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the time spent running:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking.
   - The total time she can walk or run is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance traveled running = 12 miles per hour × 2 hours = 24 miles.

4. **Determine the total distance traveled:**
   - Since no distance is calculated for walking, the total distance traveled is the distance traveled running.

28,368,ar,"Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance from the start of the trip to his second stop.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since his first stop was after 20 miles, the second stop must be at 45 miles (20 + 15 + 15 = 45).

Now, we need to find the distance from the start of the trip to his second stop. The total trip was 60 miles, and his second stop was at 45 miles. Therefore, the distance from the start to his second stop is:

\[ 60 - 45 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the distance from the start to his second stop and the distance from the start to his first stop:

\[ 15 - 15 = 0 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Henry traveled 15 miles between his first and second stops.",25,0,

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
   - Therefore, the cost for donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\).

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
   - Therefore, the cost for mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
   - Therefore, the cost for mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\).

61,376,ar,"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of the material:**
   Janet paid $500 for the material to make the brooch.

2. **Cost for the jeweler:**
   Janet paid $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Total cost before insurance:**
   To find the total cost before insurance, we add the cost of the material and the cost for the jeweler:
   \[
   500 + 800 = 1300
   \]

4. **Insurance cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost before insurance. To find 10% of $1300, we multiply $1300 by 0.10:
   \[
   1300 \times 0.10 = 130
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid is:
\[
1300 + 130 = 1430

We know from the problem that:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) back into the equation \( G = S + 30 \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(70\).",70,0,

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she initially had from the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package to find the number of Post-it notes in the package.

First, we know that Candice placed a Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee and had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package is:

\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Next, we know that Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. To find the number of Post-it notes in the package, we subtract the number of Post-it notes she initially had from the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package:

\[ 243 - 80 = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is \(163\).",163,0,

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts, and each dozen costs $68.
\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]
So, the donuts cost $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and each dozen costs $80.
\[
2 \times 80 = 160
\]
So, the mini cupcakes cost $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, and each dozen costs $55.
\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]
So, the mini cheesecakes cost $330.

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 704

1. **Calculate the number of rubies:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.
   - There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of emeralds:**
   - There are twice the number of emeralds than rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of gems:**
   - The total number of gems is the sum of the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.
   - Therefore, the total number of gems is:
     \[
     175 + 140 + 280 = 595

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had before purchasing the new package.
2. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
3. Determine how many Post-it notes were used at work.

First, we know that Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse and ended up with 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package is:
\[ 80 + 23 = 103 \]

Next, we know that she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she used at work is:
\[ 220 \]

To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially from the total number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package:
\[ 103 - 80 = 23 \]

To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds, we need to subtract the weight of the empty truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit and then divide by the weight of each box.

1. Calculate the maximum weight that can be carried by the truck:
   \[
   \text{Maximum weight} = \text{Total weight} - \text{Weight of empty truck and driver}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Maximum weight} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Maximum weight}}{\text{Weight of each box}} = \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is $83$.",83,0,

1. **Identify the initial pension amount:**
   Marcy's initial annual pension is $50,000.

2. **Determine the number of years she has worked beyond the initial 20 years:**
   Marcy works for 30 years in total, so she has worked \(30 - 20 = 10\) years beyond the initial 20 years.

3. **Calculate the additional pension for the extra years:**
   For each year beyond the initial 20 years, she earns an additional 5% of her pension. Therefore, the additional pension for the extra 10 years is \(0.05 \times 50000 \times 10 = 2500\).

4. **Calculate the total annual pension:**
   Adding the initial pension to the additional pension, we get \(50000 + 2500 = 52500\).

So, after 30 years of work, Marcy's annual pension will be \boxed{}.",25000,0,
63,424,ar,"First, calculate the cost for the first half of the year. Since the streaming service charges $140 per month, there are 6 months in the first half of the year. Thus, the total cost is:
\[
140 \times 6 = 840
\]

Next, calculate the cost for the second half of the year. The streaming service charges 10% less for the second half of the year. Therefore, the monthly cost for the second half of the year is:
\[
140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126
\]
There are 6 months in the second half of the year, so the total cost is:
\[
126 \times 6 = 756
\]

Finally, add the costs from both halves of the year to find the total amount paid:
\[
840 + 756 = 1596
\]

Thus, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[
\boxed{1596

1. Calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week.
2. Determine the total number of hours John runs in a day.
3. Use the total distance John runs in a week to find his running speed.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week:
- On the first day, he runs 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs 3/2 = 1.5 hours.
- On the third day, he runs 1.5/2 = 0.75 hours.

Total hours per week = 3 + 1.5 + 0.75 = 5.25 hours.

Since he runs 3 days a week:
- Total hours per day = 5.25 hours / 3 days = 1.75 hours per day.

Now, we can calculate his running speed:
- Speed = Distance per week / Total hours per day.
- Speed = 60 miles / 1.75 hours = 36 miles per hour.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \(38 + 2 = 40\) seconds.

2. **Calculate the improvement in Gerald's speed:**
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%.
   - To find 10% of Gerald's original time, we multiply \(40\) by \(0.10\):
     \[
     0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}

3. **Determine Gerald's new time:**
   - Subtract the improvement from Gerald's original time:

\text{Total Downloads} = \text{First Month Downloads} + \text{Second Month Downloads} + \text{Third Month Downloads}
\]

\[
\text{Total Downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   We know that there are twice as many boys as girls. Given that there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls:
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

3. **Determine the number of teachers:**
   We know that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:
   \[
   \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
- Jill is paid $20 per hour for teaching.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- Weekly earnings from teaching = $20/hour * 35 hours = $700.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from coaching:
- Jill is paid $30 per hour for coaching.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- Weekly earnings from coaching = $30/hour * 15 hours = $450.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = $700 + $450 = $1150.

Finally, let's calculate her annual salary:
- Annual salary = $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500.

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess.
   - Half of 80 is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \).
   - Therefore, the second friend says \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess.
   - 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the third friend says \( 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Next, we sum the guesses of all three friends:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes used:**
   - Freda's tomato sauce weighed 32 ounces.
   - The sauce represents half the original volume of the tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the original volume of the tomatoes was 32 ounces multiplied by 2:
     \[
     32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of 16-ounce cans used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces.
   - To find the number of cans used, divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
     \[
     \frac{64}{16} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:

Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB per minute, so the time taken to download 80 GB is:

After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 60% of the file again at a rate of 2 GB per minute.

So, the time it takes to download the remaining part of the file is:

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week:

- On the first day, John runs 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs half as much as on the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- On the third day, he runs half as much as on the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Adding these together, the total number of hours John runs in a week is:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \]

Next, we divide the total distance he runs in a week by the total number of hours he runs:
\[ \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

18,496,ar,"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
2. Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
Since Claire eats a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 3: Convert the total number of eggs to dozens.
\[ 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.",7,0,

1. **Calculate the maximum weight the truck can carry:**
   - The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
   - The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
   - Subtract this from the bridge's weight limit to find the remaining weight capacity the truck can carry.
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the maximum number of boxes:**
   - Each box weighs 15 pounds.
   - Divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes.
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \frac{1245}{15} = 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is \(83\).",83,0,

97,496,ar,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used in her last batch of tomato sauce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes used:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - When canned tomatoes are cooked, they lose half their volume.
   - Therefore, the volume of tomatoes used is twice the volume of sauce.

2. **Calculate the volume of tomatoes used:**
   - Volume of sauce = 32 ounces
   - Volume of tomatoes used = 2 * 32 ounces = 64 ounces

3. **Determine the number of cans used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - Number of cans used = Volume of tomatoes used / Volume per can
   - Number of cans used = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Total number of tomatoes = Number of cans used * Tomatoes per can
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes",12,0,

First, let's calculate the net annual profit from selling lemons:
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- The tree grows 7 lemons each year.
- Total revenue from selling lemons = $7 * 1.5 = $10.5 per year.

Next, we subtract the annual maintenance cost to find the net annual profit:
- Annual maintenance cost = $3.
- Net annual profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net annual profit to equal or exceed the initial investment of $90.

Initial investment = $90.
Net annual profit = $7.5 per year.

Number of years = Initial investment / Net annual profit = $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.",13,0,

1. **Number of Dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Number of Cats:**
   Since there are two cats for every dog, we calculate the number of cats as follows:

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. First, we find the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   Then, we calculate the number of rabbits:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168

4. **Total Number of Pets:**
   We sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total:

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Cost per dozen donuts = $68
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cupcakes = $80
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cheesecakes = $55
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries:

1. Calculate the cost of each item except the pizza.
2. Determine the total cost of the pizza boxes.
3. Divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box to find the number of boxes.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item except the pizza:
- Cost of chicken meal: $12
- Cost of 5 packs of milk: \(5 \times 3 = 15\)
- Cost of 4 apples: \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\)

Adding these costs together:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 = 33
\]

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the pizza boxes is:
\[
50 - 33 = 17
\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find the number of boxes:
\[
\frac{17}{8.50} = 2

Thus, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:

To find the total volume of the tomatoes, we multiply the volume of the sauce by 2:
\[
32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many cans of tomatoes Freda used. Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes, so we divide the total volume of the tomatoes by 16:
\[
\frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
\]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes. To find the total number of tomatoes used, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
\[
4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}

1. Calculate the number of hours the candle burns.
2. Determine the rate at which the candle melts.
3. Multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting to find the total reduction in candle length.

First, let's find out how many hours the candle burns:
- The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
- This is a total of 4 hours.

Next, we know the rate at which the candle melts:
- The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.

Now, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting to find the total reduction in candle length:
- Total reduction = number of hours × rate of melting
- Total reduction = 4 hours × 2 cm/hour
- Total reduction = 8 cm

First, let's determine the points scored in the second 20 minutes. Mike scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes. We know that he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, we can calculate the points scored in the second 20 minutes as follows:

\[
\text{Points in the second 20 minutes} = 4 + \left(\frac{25}{100} \times 4\right)
\]

\[
\text{Points in the second 20 minutes} = 4 + 1 = 5
\]

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to find the total points scored:

\[
\text{Total points} = 4 + 5 = 9
\]

Thus, the total points Mike scored in 40 minutes is:

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat with these remaining calories. Since a 300g bag contains 1250 calories, we can find the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories by dividing 200 by 1250:

The original value of the house is $50,000 (since he bought it for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs, the original value before repairs is $80,000 - $50,000 = $30,000).

The repairs increased the value by 150%. Therefore, the new value of the house is:

Next, we subtract the original purchase price from the new value to find the profit.

2. **Determine the cost of one red tie:**

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- The tree grows 7 lemons each year.
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue is \( 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual net income after subtracting the cost of watering and feeding:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.
- Thus, the annual net income is \( 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net income to cover the initial cost of $90:
- The initial cost is $90.
- The annual net income is $7.5.

27,568,ar,"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. She buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton. 

First, we need to determine how many servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
\[
1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

Next, we need to figure out how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Since each carton contains 15 servings, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

Each carton costs $4.00, so we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
\[
4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{ carton} = \$16.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream is:
\[

27,576,ar,"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of servings needed for 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
   - After 60 days, she will need \(60 \times 1 = 60\) servings.

2. **Determine how many cartons are needed:**
   - Each carton contains 15 servings.
   - To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
     \[
     \frac{60}{15} = 4
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - To find the total cost for 4 cartons, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
     \[
     4 \times 4 = 16
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is \(16\).",16,0,

Step 1: Determine how many pets Marcia has.
Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
\[ \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Step 2: Determine how many pets Jan has.
Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
\[ \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pets.
Add the number of pets each person has.
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of pets Cindy has} + \text{Number of pets Marcia has} + \text{Number of pets Jan has} \]
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week.

- On the first day, John runs 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- On the third day, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Adding these together, we get the total number of hours John runs in a week:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \]

Next, we know that John runs 60 miles in a week. To find his running speed, we divide the total distance by the total number of hours:
\[ \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of \(10\) miles per hour.",10,0,

First, calculate the monthly charge for the second half of the year.

\[ \text{Total for the second half} = 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \]

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the number of 4-yogurt packages required to cover 60 yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost of these packages.

First, let's calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-yogurt packages are required to cover 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/package}} = 15 \text{ packages} \]

Each package costs $5.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ packages} \times \$5.00/\text{package} = \$75 \]

Therefore, Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days \boxed{75",75,0,

1. Identify how many hours Harry slept.
2. Calculate how many hours James slept based on the given fraction.
3. Subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

Let's start with the first step.

- Harry slept 9 hours last night.

Next, we calculate how many hours James slept. According to the problem, James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept. Therefore, we multiply the number of hours Harry slept by \(\frac{2}{3}\):

\[
\frac{Number of hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

So, James slept 6 hours last night.

Now, we find out how many more hours Harry slept than James by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3
\]

Thus, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final answer is:

Next, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:

47,616,ar,"First, we need to determine how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, the number of blue ties he bought is:

\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
40 \times 1.5 = 60
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The total cost for the red ties is:

\[
10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[
200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount of money John spent on ties is:

\[
800

1. **Daily Time Spent on TV and Reading:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours each day.
   - Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour each day.

2. **Total Time Spent on TV and Reading per Day:**
   - Total daily time = Time spent watching TV + Time spent reading
   - Total daily time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

3. **Total Time Spent on TV and Reading per Week:**
   - Jim does this routine 3 times a week.
   - Total weekly time = Total daily time × Number of days per week
   - Total weekly time = 3 hours/day × 3 days/week = 9 hours/week

4. **Total Time Spent on TV and Reading in 4 Weeks:**
   - Total weekly time × Number of weeks
   - Total time = 9 hours/week × 4 weeks  = 36 hours

   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.

17,640,ar,"To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: her earnings as a teacher and her earnings as a cheerleading coach.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings as a teacher:
- Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- Weekly earnings as a teacher = $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings as a cheerleading coach:
- Jill earns $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach.
- She works 15 hours a week as a cheerleading coach.
- Weekly earnings as a cheerleading coach = $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week.

Now, let's calculate her combined weekly earnings:
- Combined weekly earnings = $700/week + $450/week = $1150/week.

Finally, let's calculate her annual salary:
- Annual salary = $1150/week * 50 weeks = $57500.

   \[
   10 \text{ liters} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}

2. Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
   \[
   15 \text{ liters} \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. Calculate the total amount of water before spilling:
   \[
   6.67 \text{ liters} + 9 \text{ liters} = 15.67 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. Subtract the 1 liter of spilled orange drink:
   \[
   15.67 \text{ liters} - 1 \text{ liter} = 14.67 \text{ liters}

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue for Thursday.**
- The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 per tire: \(6 \times 60 = 360\)
- The mechanic also repaired 4 car tires at $40 per tire: \(4 \times 40 = 160\)
- Total revenue for Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\)

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue for Friday.**
- The mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 per tire: \(12 \times 40 = 480\)
- Since the mechanic did not repair any truck tires on Friday, there is no revenue from truck tires.
- Total revenue for Friday: \(480 = 480\)

**Step 3: Determine the difference in revenue.**
- Revenue on Thursday: $520
- Revenue on Friday: $480
- Difference: \(520 - 480 = 40\)

1. Determine Alex's weight based on the given relationship.
2. Add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.
3. Present the final result in \(\boxed{}\).

First, we know Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Therefore, we can express Alex's weight as follows:

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2
\]

Substituting Grace's weight:

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2
\]

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2
\]

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 478
\]

Now, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight to find their combined weight:

\[
\text{Combined weight} = 125 + 478
\]

\[
\text{Combined weight} = 603
\]

2. **Determine the weight of the empty truck and the driver:**
   The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

First, let's find the total number of potted plants Mary currently has:
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
- She received 18 new potted plants.

So, the total number of potted plants is:
\[ 2 \times 40 + 18 = 80 + 18 = 98 \]

Next, let's determine how many potted plants she will give away:
- She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge.
- There are 40 ledges.

So, the number of potted plants she will give away is:

   - Total cost for mini cupcakes: \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \)

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cheesecakes: $55
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes: \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \)

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694

First, calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Total cost for shorts = \(3 \times 16.50 = 49\).

Next, calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- One pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Total cost for pants = \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\).

Finally, calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- One pair of shoes costs $42.
- Total cost for shoes = \(3 \times 42 = 126\).

Now, sum the costs of all the clothing items:
- Total cost = \(49 + 67.50 + 126 = 242.50\).

27,664,ar,"Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. She buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton. First, we need to determine how many servings she will need in 60 days.

\[
\text{Total servings needed} = 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

Next, we find out how many cartons of ice cream she needs. Since each carton contains 15 servings:

\[
\text{Number of cartons needed} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 4 cartons, each costing $4.00:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00
\]

Thus, the total amount she will spend on ice cream is:

Next, calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:

2. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Thus, he bought \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) red ties.

3. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
   - The cost of one red tie is 50% of the cost of a blue tie plus the cost of a blue tie.

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   Given that there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 120 + 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Determine the number of teachers:**
   Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:
   \[
   \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

4. Divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones:

Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest is:
\[

Adding the interest to the total cost gives the total amount to be paid:

76,688,ar,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need to use in the first year, we first need to calculate the total amount of food consumed by the puppy over the course of a year.

The puppy consumes 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

The puppy then consumes 2 cups of dog food every day for the remaining 180 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 360 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \frac{540 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

39,696,ar,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running speed, walking speed, and skipping speed, and then calculate the distance she travels in six hours based on her given activities.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.
   - If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, then her running speed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk.
   - If her running speed is 6 miles per hour, then her walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time she spends running and walking:**
   - She spends one-third of the time running, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

58,696,ar,"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to add the delivery fee, tip, and the 25% delivery fee to the original bill.

Step 1: Calculate the delivery fee.
The delivery fee is 25% of the original bill.
\[ \text{Delivery fee} = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \]

Step 2: Add the delivery fee to the original bill.
\[ \text{Total after delivery} = 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \]

Step 3: Add the delivery fee to the total after delivery.
\[ \text{Total after delivery fee} = 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 \]

Step 4: Add the tip to the total after delivery fee.
\[ \text{Final price} = 53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00 \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after the extra fees is \(57.00\).",57,0,

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Total cost for shorts = $16.50 \times 3 = $49.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Total cost for pants = $22.50 \times 3 = $67.50.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Total cost for shoes = $42 \times 3 = $126.

Now, we sum up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

We can set up the following ratio and total age equations:

1. \( \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \)
2. \( D + A = 162 \)

To eliminate the fraction in the ratio equation, multiply both sides by \( A \):

\[ 11D = 7A \]

Now we have two equations:

1. \( D + A = 162 \)
2. \( 11D = 7A \)

Since \( A = 11D \), substitute \( A \) in the first equation:

\[ D + 11D = 162 \]
\[ 12D = 162 \]

First, let's calculate the revenue from the marigolds:
- Price per pot of marigolds: $2.47
- Number of pots sold: 12
- Revenue from marigolds: $2.47 \times 12 = $34.64

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the petunias:
- Price per pot of petunias: $1.90
- Number of pots sold: 9
- Revenue from petunias: $1.90 \times 9 = $17.10

Now, let's calculate the revenue from the begonias:
- Price per pot of begonias: $2.12
- Number of pots sold: 17
- Revenue from begonias: $2.12 \times 17 = $36.04

For the first 180 days, the puppy is fed 1 cup of dog food per day:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy is fed 2 cups of dog food per day:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these together, the total amount of dog food needed in the first year is:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:

Next, let's determine the monthly amount for the second half of the year. Since the streaming service charges 10% less for the second half of the year, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140:

0.10 \times \$140 = \$14

So, the monthly amount for the second half of the year is:

\$140 - \$14 = \$126

Since the second half of the year is also 6 months, we can calculate the total cost for the second half as follows:

2. Determine John's running speed by dividing the total miles he runs in a week by the total hours he runs in a week.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week.

- John runs 3 hours on the first day.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as on the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day. Therefore, he runs a total of \( 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \) hours on these two days.
- Adding these together, the total hours run in a week is \( 3 + 3 = 6 \) hours.

Next, we calculate John's running speed by dividing the total miles he runs in a week by the total hours he runs in a week.

- John runs 60 miles a week.
- Therefore, his running speed is \( \frac{60}{6} = 10 \) miles per hour.

Next, calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Since she worked 45 hours in total:
\[ 45 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Now, calculate her earnings for the overtime hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, add her earnings from the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - He bought 5 blue ties because $200 / $40 = 5.

2. Next, we determine the cost of one red tie:
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - 50% of $40 is $20.
   - Therefore, one red tie costs $40 + $20 = $60.

3. Now, we calculate the total cost for the blue ties:
   - Total cost for blue ties = 5 blue ties * $40 per tie = $200.

4. Similarly, we calculate the total cost for the red ties:
   - Total cost for red ties = (2 * 5) red ties * $60 per tie = $600.

5. Finally, we sum the costs of all the ties:
   - Total cost for all ties = $200 (blue) + $600 (red) = $800.

1. Identify the number of instructions in the first recipe.
2. Calculate the number of instructions in the second recipe.
3. Add the number of instructions from both recipes.

First, we know that the first recipe has 20 instructions.

Next, the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. Therefore, we calculate the number of instructions in the second recipe as follows:
\[ \text{Number of instructions in the second recipe} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, we add the number of instructions from both recipes to find the total:
\[ \text{Total number of instructions} = \text{Number of instructions in the first recipe} + \text{Number of instructions in the second recipe} = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

31,768,ar,"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of jelly beans each friend thinks are in the jar.
2. Add up all the guesses.
3. Divide the total by the number of friends to get the average.

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half of 80:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40
   \]
3. The third friend says 25% more than 80:
   \[
   80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, add up all the guesses:
\[
80 + 40 + 100 = 220
\]

Divide the total by the number of friends to find the average:
\[
\frac{220}{3} = 73.3333 \ldots \approx 73.33

1. **Calculate the 25% delivery fee:**
   The delivery fee is 25% of the original bill amount.
   \[
   \text{Delivery fee} = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
   \]

2. **Add the delivery fee to the original bill:**
   \[
   40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00
   \]

3. **Add the delivery fee of $3.00:**
   \[
   50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00
   \]

4. **Add the tip:**
   \[
   53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00
   \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is \(57.00\).",57,0,

63,768,ar,"First, let's determine how much Aleena paid for the first half of the year. Since the streaming service charges her $140 per month, the first half of the year consists of 6 months.

\[
\text{Amount for the first half} = 140 \times 6 = 840
\]

Next, let's calculate the amount paid for the second half of the year. The streaming company charges her 10% less than the initial amount for the second half.

\[
\text{Discounted amount} = 140 - 0.10 \times 140 = 140 - 14 = 126
\]

The second half of the year also consists of 6 months, so:

\[
\text{Amount for the second half} = 126 \times 6 = 756
\]

Finally, let's add the amounts paid for both halves to find the total amount paid for the year:

\[
\text{Total amount} = 840 + 756 = 1596

She walked 4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the next hour, so she has walked a total of \(4 + 2 = 6\) miles.

Next, we need to find out how many miles she has left to walk. The total trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has \(12 - 6 = 6\) miles left to walk.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12 miles. To find the total time she needs to finish the trail at this average speed, we divide the total distance by the average speed:

\[
\frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we need to determine the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 2 hours. She has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, so she has \(3 - 2 = 1\) hour left.

82,784,ar,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the combined weights of Grace and Alex. Let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Determine Alex's weight.**

Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Therefore, we calculate Alex's weight as follows:

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2
\]

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2
\]

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2
\]

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 498
\]

**Step 2: Calculate their combined weights.**

To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we add their individual weights together:

\[
\text{Combined weights} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight}
\]

\[
\text{Combined weights} = 125 + 498
\]

\[
\text{Combined weights} = \boxed{62",623,0,

1. First, calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days:
   \[
   1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 180 days:
   \[
   2 \text{ cups/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 360 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Add the amounts from both periods to get the total consumption:
   \[
   180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. Determine how many bags are needed:
   \[

95,808,ar,"First, we determine the number of boys in Grade 5. Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we find the number of girls in Grade 5. Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. Therefore, the number of girls in the Girl Scouts is:

\[
\text{Number of girls in the Girl Scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Finally, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts is:

\[
\text{Number of girls not in the Girl Scouts} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts is:

41,816,ar,"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when not holding the gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance she can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
3. Subtract the reach of the dragon's flames from the distance she can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.

1. Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone.
2. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, she can throw it:
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the reach she can stand, we calculate:
   \[
   1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

Add the time taken for the restart to the time to download the remaining data:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a week.
2. Convert the number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs produced in a week:
- Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the number of eggs produced in a week is:
  \[
  252 \times 7 = 1764
  \]

Next, we convert the number of eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Therefore, the number of dozens produced in a week is:
  \[
  \frac{1764}{12} = 147
  \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- Lloyd sells each dozen for $2.

Thus, the total revenue per week is:
\[
147 \times 2 = 294

66,840,ar,"To determine the total number of people sent by the four schools, we need to consider the players and coaches each school has sent and then sum these up for all four schools.

First, let's calculate the number of players each school has sent:
- Each school has one girls' team and one boys' team.
- Each team has 5 players.
- Therefore, each school has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) players.

Next, let's add the coaches each school has sent:
- There is one coach for each team.
- Since there are 2 teams per school, each school also has 2 coaches.

Now, let's add the players and coaches together to find the total number of people each school has sent:
- Total people per school = players + coaches
- Total people per school = 10 + 2 = 12

Finally, we multiply the total number of people sent per school by the number of schools:
- Total people = 12 people/school \(\times\) 4 schools = 48 people

Thus, the total number of people sent by all the schools is \(48\).",48,0,

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   - Downloads in the second month = \(3 \times 60 = 180\).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - Reduction in downloads = \(0.30 \times 180 = 54\).
   - Downloads in the third month = \(180 - 54 = 126\).

Now, we sum the downloads from all three months:

\[
\text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire.
- On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires.
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- On Thursday, the mechanic also repairs 4 car tires.
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Total revenue for Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic charges $40 for each car tire.
- On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires.
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- There are no truck tires repaired on Friday.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons.
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total annual cost of maintaining the tree and the initial cost of planting the tree:
- The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.
- Therefore, the total annual cost is \(90 + 3 = 93\) dollars.

To find out how many years it will take for the revenue to cover the cost, we divide the total annual cost by the annual revenue:

31,864,ar,"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine each friend's guess.
2. Add all the guesses together.
3. Divide the total by the number of friends.

First, let's find each friend's guess:
- The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses 20 more than half the first friend's guess: \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \).
- The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess: \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \).

Now, we add all the guesses together:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Next, we divide the total by the number of friends (which is 3):
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

Therefore, the average guess is \(80\).",80,0,

1. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire day.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon.

First, let's calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire day. Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed. Therefore, the total amount of feed needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon. Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given so far is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:

1. Determine Alex's weight.
2. Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight.

First, let's calculate Alex's weight:

- Grace weighs 125 pounds.
- Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.

Calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]

Then, subtract 2 pounds from 500 to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Next, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight to find the combined weight:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds.

1. A regular glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of the price of a regular glass.

Let's calculate the cost of a second glass:
\[ \text{Cost of a second glass} = 0.6 \times 5 = 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of regular glasses and second glasses:
- Total glasses: 16
- Number of second glasses: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
- Number of regular glasses: \( 16 - 8 = 8 \)

Next, we calculate the total cost of each type of glass:
- Total cost for regular glasses: \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \)
- Total cost for second glasses: \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \)

Finally, we add the costs of both types of glasses to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 40 + 24 = 64 \]

33,888,ar,"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + G = 110 \]

We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Therefore, we can write:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

So, the number of silver coins is 40. To find the number of gold coins, we use the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 \ gold coins.",70,0,

1. Calculate the 25% delivery fee.
2. Add the delivery fee to the original bill.
3. Add the $3.00 in delivery fees.
4. Add the $4.00 tip.

First, let's calculate the 25% delivery fee:
\[
25\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = \$10.00
\]

Next, add this fee to the original bill:
\[
40.00 + 10.00 = \$50.00
\]

Then, add the $3.00 in delivery fees:
\[
50.00 + 3.00 = \$53.00

Finally, add the $4.00 tip:
\[

3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost of supplies to make 20 candles. Since each candle requires one pound of beeswax and one wick, and one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, the total cost is:
\[ 20 \times 10 = 200 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit:
\[ 40 - 200 = -160 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates a loss, not a profit. Therefore, the net profit is:

Next, we need to determine how much weight Uriah has left to remove after removing the comic books. The total weight he needs to remove is 15 pounds. After removing 7.5 pounds of comic books, the remaining weight is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds of weight with toys, and each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[

2. Calculate the total number of students at the school.
3. Determine the number of teachers based on the given ratio of students to teachers.

First, we know there are 60 girls at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180

We are given that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the ratio:

21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
\]

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen:

\[
84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

2. Subtract the calories already consumed: 1800 calories.

   \[
   2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories remaining}
   \]

3. Determine how many servings you can eat based on the remaining calorie limit:
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - You can eat \(\frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8\) servings.

4. Calculate the total number of servings you can eat:
   - Each bag has 5 servings.
   - You can eat 0.8 servings.
   - Total servings you can eat = \(0.8 \times 5 = 4\) servings.

5. Calculate the total grams of chips you can eat:

1. Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.
3. Calculate the total number of hours spent on each day.
4. Sum the total number of hours spent over the three days.

First, let's calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday:
- Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles.

Next, let's calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday:
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours spent on each day:
- Each article takes 4 hours to research and write.
- On Monday, she spent \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.
- On Tuesday, she spent \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

1. **Initial Pension**: Marcy starts with an annual pension of $50,000.

2. **First 20 Years**: She works for the first 20 years at the initial pension rate of $50,000 per year.

3. **Remaining Years**: After 20 years, she works for another 10 years. During these years, she becomes entitled to 5% of her pension per year.

4. **Calculations**:
   - For the first 20 years, her pension is $50,000 per year.
   - For the remaining 10 years, her pension is 5% of $50,000 per year, which is $2,500 per year.

5. **Final Pension**: Since she quits after 30 years, her pension will be $2,500 per year.

2. Since Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.
3. Dana can run four times faster than she walks, so her walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.
4. If Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she spends \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours running and \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours walking.
5. The distance she runs in 2 hours is \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12\) miles.
6. The distance she walks in 4 hours is \(1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6\) miles.
7. The total distance she travels in six hours is \(12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}\).

1. **Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week:**
   - Claire eats 3 eggs every morning.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, in one week, she eats:
     \[
     3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}

2. **Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks:**
   - In one week, she eats 21 eggs.
   - In 4 weeks, she eats:

3. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings.
   - Total calories in a 300g bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

2. Calculate the remaining calories allowed:
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. Determine how many grams of chips can be eaten with 200 calories:
   - Each 300g bag contains 1250 calories.
   - To find out how many grams you can eat with 200 calories, divide 200 calories by 1250 calories/300g:
     \[
     \frac{200}{1250} \times 300 = 48 \text{ grams}

6,944,ar,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

3. **Calculate the total number of sheep in all three cities:**
   - The total number of sheep is the sum of the sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.
   - Total = 160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle)
   - Total = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

Thus, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is \(260\).",260,0,

62,960,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we need to follow the steps and conditions given in the problem.

1. **Initial Pension Calculation:**
   - If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.

2. **Percentage Calculation:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

3. **Years of Employment Calculation:**
   - Marcy works for 30 years, which is more than 20 years but less than 40 years.

4. **Annual Pension Calculation:**
   - If Marcy works for 30 years, she will be entitled to 5% of the initial pension value per year.
   - The initial pension value is $50,000.
   - Therefore, 5% of $50,000 is \(0.05 \times 50000 = 2500\).

Thus, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $2500.",25000,0,

12,968,ar,"First, let's calculate the revenue Carlos will get from selling lemons each year. He can sell 7 lemons at $1.5 each, so the revenue is:

\[ 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \]

Next, we need to account for the cost of water and feeding the tree each year, which is $3. The net annual revenue is:

\[ 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \]

Now, let's determine how many years it will take for the net revenue to exceed the initial cost of planting the tree. The initial cost is $90, so we need to find the minimum number of years \( t \) such that:

\[ 7.5t > 90 \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ t > \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ t > 12 \]

Since the number of years must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:

\[ t = 13 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 13 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.",13,0,

1. **Calculate the number of boys:**
   - We know there are twice as many boys as girls.
   - Given that there are 60 girls, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of students:**
   - The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls.
   - Therefore, the total number of students is:
     \[
     \text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of teachers:**
   - We know there are 5 students to every teacher.
   - To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5:
     \[
     \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:
- The orange drink is 10 liters and is two-thirds water.
- Amount of water in orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = 7 \) liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is 15 liters and is three-fifths water.
- Amount of water in pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, let's account for the spilled orange drink:
- One liter of the orange drink is spilled, which is two-thirds water.
- Amount of water in spilled orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \) liters.

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of liquid is:

1. We know that the total number of coins is 110:
   \[
   G + S = 110
   \]

2. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \[
   G = S + 30
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( G \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
(S + 30) + S = 110
\]
\[
2S + 30 = 110
\]
\[
2S = 80
\]
\[
S = 40

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting \( S \) back into the second equation:
\[
G = 40 + 30 = 70

Next, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:

2. Determine how much weight is left to be removed after removing the comic books.
3. Calculate how many toys are needed to remove the remaining weight.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight is:

Finally, we need to determine how many toys are required to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys needed is:

18,992,ar,"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
2. Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire eats in one week. She makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week.
\[
3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
\[
21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
\]

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
\[
\frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens}
\]

Thus, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the sale price.

1. Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he eats:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ yogurts}
   \]

2. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts, we divide 60 by 4:
   \[
   60 \div 4 = 15 \text{ sets}
   \]

3. Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00. Therefore, the total cost for 15 sets is:
   \[
   15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ dollars}

1. **Determine Raymond's current age:**
   - Samantha's current age is 31 years.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, Raymond's current age is:
     \[
     31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Determine the age difference between Raymond and his son:**
   - Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 23 years old.
   - Since Raymond is currently 25 years old, the age difference between him and his son is:
     \[
     25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of years ago:**
   - If the age difference is 2 years, and the son was born 2 years ago (since the son is 2 years younger than Raymond), then:
     \[
     2 - 2 = 0 \text{ years}

Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Step 1: Understand the discount.
The discount is 25%, which means Kyle paid 75% of the original price.

Step 2: Set up the equation.
Since Kyle paid 75% of the original price, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

Step 3: Solve for \( P \).
To find \( P \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Step 4: Perform the division.
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was \(26\).",26,0,

Given:
- Total number of students = 200
- Fraction of boys = \frac{2}{5}\)

Number of boys = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80\)

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the Girl Scout.

Given:
- Fraction of girls in the Girl Scout = \(\frac{2}{3}\)

Number of girls in the Girl Scout = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80\)

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the Girl Scout, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the Girl Scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the Girl Scout
Number of girls not in the Girl Scout = 120 - 80 = 40
