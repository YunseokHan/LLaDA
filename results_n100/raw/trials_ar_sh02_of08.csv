   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings.
   - Total calories = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

2. Determine the number of calories left to consume:
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Calories left = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. Determine how many grams you can eat with the remaining calories:
   - The total calories in a 300g bag of chips are 1250 calories.
   - To find out how many grams you can eat with 200 calories, use the ratio:
     \
     \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{200}{1250} = 0.16 \text{ grams/calorie}

1. **Initial Total Bill:**

2. **Delivery Fee:**
   The delivery fee is 25% of the initial total.
   \[
   0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
   \]

   Adding this to the initial total:
   \[
   40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00

3. **Delivery Fee:**
   The delivery fee is $3.00.
   \[
   50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00
   \]

4. **Tip:**
   The tip is $4.00.

1. **Calculate the volume of the tomatoes used before cooking:**
   - After cooking, the volume of the tomatoes is halved.
   - Freda's last batch made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes used before cooking is:
     \[
     32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of cans used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - To find the number of cans, divide the total volume used by the volume per can:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of supplies for 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

1. **Total Revenue from Selling 20 Candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the revenue from selling 20 candles is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Total Cost of Supplies for 20 Candles:**
   - One pound of beeswax and wicks cost $10.00.
   - Since 10 candles are made from 1 pound of beeswax, 20 candles will require 2 pounds of beeswax.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars.

3. **Net Profit:**
   - Subtract the total cost from the total revenue: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) dollars.

1. **First time:**
   The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second time:**
   The alarm rang for three times as long as the first time. Since it rang 4 times the first time, it rang:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ times}

3. **Third time:**
   The alarm rang for half as long as the second time. Since it rang 12 times the second time, it rang:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ times}
   \]

4. **Total number of rings:**
   To find the total number of rings, we add the number of rings from each time the alarm went off:
   \[
   4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \text{ times}

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd can sell in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week.

\[
252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd can sell in a week.**

There are 12 eggs in a dozen. Therefore, we divide the total number of eggs per week by 12.

\[
\frac{1764}{12} = 147
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. Therefore, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue for Thursday**
- On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360
  \]
- On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 4 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160
  \]
- Total revenue for Thursday:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue for Friday**
- On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480
  \]

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday**
- Difference:
  \[
  520 - 480 = 40

1. **Identify the initial number of cars:**
   There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Account for the cars that took an exit:**
   5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

3. **Calculate the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam:**
   Subtract the number of cars that took an exit from the initial number of cars.
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25
   \]

4. **Determine how many cars drove through in the second 15 minutes:**
   20 cars drove through in the second 15 minutes.
   Subtract the number of cars that drove through in the second 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through to find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.
   \[
   25 - 20 = 5

1. **Option 1: Working 40 years**
   - Marcy gets an annual pension of $50,000.

2. **Option 2: Working 20 years**
   - Starting after 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Given that Marcy quits after 30 years, she has not met the full criteria of the 40-year option. Therefore, she will be eligible for the 20-year option.

Let's assume the total pension value is \( P \). After 30 years, Marcy will be entitled to 5% of the pension value per year. However, the problem does not provide the total pension value.

Since we do not have the total pension value, we cannot calculate the exact annual pension. The problem as stated is incomplete to determine the exact annual pension.

65,50,ar,"To determine the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Daily Time Spent on TV and Reading:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours each day.
   - He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour each day.
   - Therefore, in one day, Jim spends \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours on TV and reading.

2. **Weekly Time Spent on TV and Reading:**
   - Jim does this routine 3 times a week.
   - So, in one week, he spends \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) hours on TV and reading.

3. **Total Time Spent on TV and Reading in 4 Weeks:**
   - In one week, Jim spends 9 hours.
   - Over 4 weeks, he spends \( 9 \times 4 = 36 \) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 36 hours.",36,0,

\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, let's calculate how much dog food the puppy will consume in the next 180 days. The puppy is fed 2 cups per day, so:

\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 360 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required if one bag contains 110 cups:

\[ 540 \text{ cups} \div 110 \text{ cups/bag} = 5 \]

After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10%, so it becomes $7200 + $7200 * 0.10 = $7200 + $720 = $7920 per year. After another year, her salary will be $7920 + $7920 * 0.10 = $7920 + $792 = $8712 per year. After another year, her salary will be $8712 + $8712 * 0.10 = $8712 + $871.2 = $9583.20 per year.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.

The cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.

The cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[ 6 \times 55 = 330 \]
The cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

\text{Number of attendees who show up} = 16 - 4 = 12
\]

Next, we calculate the number of gift bags needed. Since she needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, we multiply the number of invited friends by the number of gift bags per guest:

\[
\text{Number of gift bags needed} = 16 \times 0.75 = 12
\]

Finally, we determine the total cost of the gift bags. Since each gift bag costs $2, we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 12 \times 2 = 24
\]

Thus, Christina will spend:

1. Calculate the increased value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the original purchase price from the increased value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the increased value of the house after the repairs. The house's value increased by 150% due to the $50,000 in repairs.

\[
\text{Increased value} = 150\% \text{ of } \$50,000 + \$50,000 = 1.5 \times \$50,000 + \$50,000 = \$75,000 + \$50,000 = \$125,000
\]

Next, we subtract the original purchase price from the increased value to find the profit.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Increased value} - \text{Original purchase price} = \$125,000 - \$80,000 = \$45,000

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sprints James runs in a week.**

James runs 3 sprints each time and does this 3 times a week. Therefore, the total number of sprints in a week is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total distance James runs in each sprint.**

James runs 60 meters each sprint.

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance James runs in one session.**

Since he runs 3 sprints in each session, the distance he runs in one session is:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.**

Since he runs 3 sessions a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:

Next, we sum up the costs of these items:

Let \(x\) be the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered. Each box costs $8.50, so the total cost of the pizzas is \(8.50x\).

According to the problem, the total amount paid is $50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

To solve for \(x\), we subtract 33 from both sides of the equation:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after the purchase.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes Candice had initially from the total number of Post-it notes she had after the purchase to find out how many Post-it notes she purchased.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
Candice used 220 Post-it notes to place on the cups of coffee.

Step 2: Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after the purchase.
Candice had 80 Post-it notes initially and used 220 of them. Therefore, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. So, the total number of Post-it notes she had after the purchase is:
\[ 80 + 220 + 23 = 323 \]

Step 3: Since she had 80 Post-it notes initially, she purchased:

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Given:
- There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars took the exit.
- 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam:

\[ x + 20 + 5 - 30 = 0 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 20 + 5 - 30 = 0 \]
\[ x + 20 - 35 = 0 \]
\[ x - 15 = 0 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(15\).",5,0,

Carla downloads 40% of the file:

Next, calculate the remaining portion of the file:
\[ 200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB} \]

Now, determine the download time for the first 80 GB:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Calculate the download time for the remaining 120 GB:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add the restart time to the download time:

47,114,ar,"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 \times 1.5 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600

93,114,ar,"First, we know that Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Let's denote Gerald's original time as \( G \) seconds. Therefore, Lee's original time is \( G - 2 \) seconds.

Given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can set up the equation:
\[ G - 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald's original time is 40 seconds.

Next, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \]

Adding this to his original time:
\[ 40 + 4 = 36 \]

Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

1. **Monday:**

2. **Tuesday:**

   - Number of articles written on Tuesday = \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \)

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles written on Wednesday = \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \)

Next, we sum the number of articles written over the three days:

   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - The first half of the year consists of 6 months.
   - Total cost for the first half = $140 \times 6 = $840.

2. Calculate the total cost for the second half of the year:
   - The streaming service charges 10% less for the second half.
   - 10% of $140 = 0.10 \times 140 = $14.
   - Therefore, the reduced monthly charge is $140 - $14 = $126.
   - The second half of the year consists of 6 months.
   - Total cost for the second half = $126 \times 6 = $756.

3. Calculate the total cost for the entire year:
   - Total cost = Cost for the first half + Cost for the second half.
   - Total cost = $840 + $756 = $1596.

After the first year, her salary will be:

\[ 7200 + (0.10 \times 7200) = 7200 + 720 = 7920 \]

After the second year, her salary will be:

39,138,ar,"1. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
2. Since Dana can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run, we can determine her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
3. Since she can run four times faster than she can walk, we can determine her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
4. Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If she spends one-third of the time running, she spends (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours running. If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, she spends (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours walking.
5. Therefore, she covers 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles running and 4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles walking.
6. The total distance she covers in six hours is 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each: \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each: \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Total revenue for Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each: \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- Total revenue for Friday: \(480 + 0 = 480\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
\[
520 - 480 = 40

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, we know that Claire eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[
3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks:
\[
21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
\]

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide 84 by 12:
\[
84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens}
\]

   Henry made his first stop after 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from the start to the first stop is:
   \[
   20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance between the first and second stops:**
   The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the distances from the start of the trip to each stop:

   30 - 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

4. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes. Then:
   \[
   x + 20 = 25
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = 25 - 20 = 5
   \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:
\[

1. Calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week.
2. Determine his running speed by dividing the total miles he runs in a week by the total hours he runs in a week.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week:

- On the first day, John runs 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- On the third day, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Adding these up:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \]

So, John runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find his running speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours:
\[ \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

Therefore, John's running speed is:
\[ 10 \] miles per hour.",10,0,

1. Calculate the square footage of each level.
2. Sum the square footage of all levels.
3. Divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average.

First, let's denote the square footage of the top level as \( S_1 = 16 \).

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can express the square footage of the subsequent levels as follows:
- Level 2: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
- Level 3: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \)
- Level 4: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \)

Next, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

Finally, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels (4) to find the average:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7 \]",60,0,

Now, we add the two amounts together:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups by the amount in one bag:

2,162,ar,"Josh buys a house for $80,000 and spends $50,000 on repairs. The repairs increase the value of the house by 150%. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the house after the repairs:

\[
80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
\]

Next, we calculate the increase in value:

\[
130,000 \times 1.50 = 195,000
\]

Adding this increase to the original value gives the new value of the house:

\[
130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (original purchase price plus repairs) from the new value of the house:

\[
325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000

- For the first 180 days: 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups
- For the remaining 185 days: 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Total dog food consumed in a year:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are needed. Each bag contains 110 cups.

Number of bags needed:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

52,178,ar,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removes. Each comic book weighs \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[
\text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine the remaining weight he needs to remove after removing the comic books. The total weight he needs to remove is 15 pounds, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books.

\[
\text{Remaining weight to remove} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound, so we need to find out how many toys are required to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds.

\[
\text{Number of toys to remove} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

1. **Kittens adopted from the shelter:**
   The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the shelter.

2. **Kittens from Patchy:**
   Patchy has had three times the number of kittens adopted from the shelter. Since 7 kittens were adopted, Patchy has had:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

3. **Kittens from Trixie:**
   Trixie has had 12 kittens.

4. **Total number of kittens:**
   To find the total, we add the kittens adopted from the shelter, the kittens from Patchy, and the kittens from Trixie:
   \[
   7 + 21 + 12 = 40
   \]

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.

1. **Calculate the number of blue ties:**
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost per blue tie = $200 / $40 = 5.

2. **Determine the number of red ties:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties = 2 * 5 = 10.

3. **Calculate the cost per red tie:**
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - Cost per red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the red ties:**
   - Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie = 10 * $60 = $600.

1. **Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. Therefore, in 30 days, he eats:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ yogurts}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of packs of yogurts needed:**
   The yogurt is sold in packs of 4 yogurts. To find out how many packs are needed for 60 yogurts, we divide 60 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ packs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the yogurts:**
   Each pack costs $5.00. Therefore, the total cost for 15 packs is:
   \[
   15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ dollars}

1. **First half of the year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Therefore, the total amount paid for the first half is \(140 \times 6 = 840\).

2. **Second half of the year:**
   - The streaming service charges 10% less than the initial amount for the second half of the year.
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Therefore, the total amount paid for the second half is \(140 \times (6 - 0.1 \times 6) = 140 \times 5.4 = 756\).

3. **Total amount paid for the entire year:**

   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as in the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \(3 \times 60 = 180\).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   - To find the third month's downloads, we calculate \(180 - 0.30 \times 180 = 180 - 54 = 126\).

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**

3. Determine how many years it will take for the net earnings to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.

**Step 1: Calculate the yearly earnings from selling lemons.**
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- The tree grows 7 lemons each year.
- Yearly earnings from selling lemons = 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5.

**Step 2: Subtract the yearly cost of water and feed the tree from the yearly earnings.**
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.
- Net earnings per year = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

**Step 3: Determine how many years it will take for the net earnings to cover the initial cost.**
- The initial cost is $90.
- The net earnings per year are $7.5.
- Number of years needed = $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

From the problem, we know two things:

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, there are 40 silver coins. To find the number of gold coins, we use the second equation:

2. Determine the number of red ties John buys.
3. Calculate the total cost of the red ties.
4. Add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent.

First, we know that each blue tie costs $40 and John spent $200 on blue ties. Therefore, the number of blue ties is \(\frac{200}{40} = 5\).

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he buys \(2 \times 5 = 10\) red ties.

The cost of one red tie is 50% more than the cost of one blue tie, so it is \(40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 60\).

   - Annual earnings as a cheerleading coach = $450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22500/year.

33,218,ar,"Let the number of silver coins be \( S \) and the number of gold coins be \( G \).

We know from the problem that:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Using these conditions, we can write the following equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, substitute the expression for \( G \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40. Now, use the expression for \( G \) to find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(70\).",70,0,

11,226,ar,"To determine the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \)

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \)

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \)

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries:
\[ 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \]

\[ 200 \times 0.4 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 80 GB. Since Carla's download speed is 2 GB per minute, the time required is:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add the time taken for the download to the time taken for the restart. The download time from the beginning to the restart is 20 minutes (since she is restarting after 40% of the download) and the download time from the restart to the end is 40 minutes. Therefore, the total download time is:

63,234,ar,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half.

1. **First half of the year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - For the first 6 months, the cost is \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second half of the year:**
   - The streaming service charges 10% less money for the second half of the year.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the new monthly charge is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - For the remaining 6 months, the cost is \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total amount paid:**
   - Adding the costs for both halves of the year, we get \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

\[
\text{Total sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday. There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).
  \[
  5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}
  \]

- She teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
  \[
  25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes}
  \]

- Each class has 15 students.
  \[
  33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}
  \]

- Judy charges $15.00 per student.
  \[
  495 \text{ students} \times 15.00/\text{student} = 7425.00/\text{week}

1. Calculate each friend's guess.
2. Add all the guesses together.
3. Divide the total by the number of friends to get the average.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Next, we add these guesses together:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

Finally, we divide the total by the number of friends, which is 3:
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80

2. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
3. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

Let's denote the number of blue ties John buys as \( x \).

1. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he buys \( 2x \) red ties.
2. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so the cost of each red tie is \( 40 \times 1.5 = 60 \).
3. The total cost for blue ties is \( 40x \).
4. The total cost for red ties is \( 60 \times 2x = 120x \).
5. We know \( 40x = 200 \), so \( x = 5 \).

Now, the total cost of red ties is \( 120 \times 5 = 600 \).

Finally, the total cost for all ties is \( 200 + 600 = 800 \).",800,0,

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750
   \]

2. Next, we need to calculate the interest for each cell phone. The interest is 2% of the original price:
   \[
   \text{Interest per cell phone} = 150 \times 0.02 = 3
   \]

3. For five cell phones, the total interest is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]

4. Adding the interest to the total cost gives the total amount to be paid in installments.
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 750 + 15 = 765

5. Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

11,274,ar,"To determine the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of the donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Cost per dozen donuts = $68
   - Total cost for donuts = $3 \times 68 = 204$

2. **Cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cupcakes = $80
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = $2 \times 80 = 160$

3. **Cost of the mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cheesecakes = $55
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = $6 \times 55 = 330$

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694

First, let's calculate the distance traveled during the outbound trip. Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM). The distance covered during this time is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to determine the time it takes to travel back. Tom travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We use the same distance of 30 miles to find the time:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours}
\]

Therefore, the time it takes for Tom to get back is:

Given that their total age now is 162, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]
\[ 18x = 162 \]

Next, we solve for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

Now, we can find Darrell and Allen's current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

Finally, we need to calculate Allen's age 10 years from now:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now will be \(109\).",109,0,

Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, which is the sum of the silver coins and the gold coins. We can set up the following equation:
\[
s + (s + 30) = 110
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2s + 30 = 110
\]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[
2s = 80
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
s = 40
\]

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Since the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30 to the number of silver coins:
\[
s + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.",70,0,

2. With the gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than without the gemstone.

To find out how far she could throw the javelin with the gemstone:
- Multiply her maximum throw distance without the gemstone by 3.
- So, \(400 \times 3 = 1200\) feet.

3. Now, we need to determine how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames she can stand while still hitting the dragon with the gemstone. The dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet.

To find out how far outside the reach she can stand:
- Subtract the maximum reach of the dragon's flames from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.
- So, \(1200 - 1000 = 200\) feet.

Therefore, Polly could stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin. \boxed{200",200,0,

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does as follows:

\[
\text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}

96,290,ar,"To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of hours James slept.
2. Subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

First, we know that Harry slept 9 hours. James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. Therefore, we can calculate the number of hours James slept as follows:

\[
\text{Harry's sleep} = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep}
\]

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

\[
\boxed{3

61,298,ar,"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to break down the costs and add them up step by step.

1. **Material Cost:**
   Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch.

2. **Jeweler's Construction Cost:**
   Janet pays $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Insurance Cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost of the material and construction. First, we calculate the total cost:
   \[
   500 + 800 = 1300
   \]
   Now, we find 10% of $1300:
   \[
   1300 \times 0.10 = 130
   \]

4. **Total Amount Paid:**
   Finally, we add up all the costs:
   \[
   500 + 800 + 130 = 1430
   \]

Thus, the total amount Janet paid is:

Next, we need to account for the download process being interrupted at 40% of the file size. Since the file is 200 GB, 40% of the file size is 80 GB. At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time taken to download 80 GB is:

\[
\text{Time for 40% download} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}

However, the download is interrupted for 20 minutes during the update. Therefore, the actual time for the download is:

1. **Calculate the cost of supplies for 20 candles:**
   - Each candle requires 10/10 = 20 pounds of beeswax (since each pound makes 10 candles).
   - Therefore, 20 candles require 20 * 20 = 40 pounds of beeswax.
   - The cost for 40 pounds of beeswax is $40 * $10.00 = $400.

2. **Calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Revenue - Cost of supplies.
   - Net profit = $40 - $400 = -$360.

Since the net profit is negative, it means Charlie is incurring a loss.

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

1. **Calculate the number of eggs produced per week:**
   - Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the number of eggs produced per week is \(252 \times 7 = 1764\) eggs.

2. **Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - The number of dozens of eggs produced per week is \(1764 \div 12 = 147\) dozens.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:**
   - Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling the eggs per week is \(147 \times 2 = 294\) dollars.

2. Subtract the number of lollipops Jean eats.
3. Determine how many lollipops are left.
4. Calculate how many bags can be filled with the remaining lollipops, given that each bag contains 2 lollipops.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. Jean starts with 30 lollipops.
2. Jean eats 2 lollipops. So, we subtract 2 from 30:
   \[
   30 - 2 = 28
   \]
   Now, Jean has 28 lollipops left.
3. To find out how many bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops, each bag containing 2 lollipops, we divide the number of lollipops by 2:
   \[
   28 \div 2 = 14
   \]
   Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags.

24,322,ar,"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid (after a 25% discount) represents 75% of the original price. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:

\[ \text{Price paid} = 0.75 \times \text{Original price} \]

Given that Kyle paid $19.50, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 19.50 = 0.75 \times \text{Original price} \]

To solve for the original price, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ \text{Original price} = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final answer is \(26.00\).",26,0,

First, let's establish the initial pension structure:
- For the first 40 years, Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000 per year.
- Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of her pension per year.

If Marcy quits after 30 years, she does not qualify for the $50,000 annual pension because she has not worked for the full 40 years.

Next, let's calculate her pension if she starts at 20 years and works for 10 additional years:
- For the first 10 years, she receives 5% of her pension per year.

Since she starts receiving 5% of the pension at 20 years and works for 10 years, we need to find the annual pension for those 10 years. However, the problem does not provide the exact annual pension value at the 20-year mark. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numeric result without this information.",25000,0,

2. On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes:

1. The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says there are 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend says there are \(40 + 20 = 60\) jelly beans.
3. The third friend says there are 25% more than 80. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so the third friend says there are \(80 + 20 = 100\) jelly beans.

Now, we add up the guesses of all three friends:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

To find the average guess, we divide the total number of jelly beans by the number of friends, which is 3:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since he sold 13 lego sets, he must have 13 - 30 = -17 lego sets left.

However, since he can't have negative lego sets, it indicates that he has 13 lego sets and only 17 dollars left.

Therefore, he still has 13 lego sets and 17 dollars left, but since he can't buy more lego sets with 17 dollars, he still has 13 lego sets.

On the first day, John runs 3 hours.
On the other two days, he runs half as much as on the first day, so each day he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours he runs in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs 60 miles a week. To find his running speed, we divide the total distance he runs in a week by the total number of hours he runs in a week.

So, his running speed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

2. **Jeweler's Cost:**
   Janet pays $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Insurance Cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost to get it insured. First, we calculate the total cost of the material and the jeweler's construction:

27,346,ar,"Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. She buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton.

First, let's determine how many servings of ice cream she will consume in 60 days. Since she eats 1 serving per night, in 60 days she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Each carton contains 15 servings, so we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings per carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, let's find out how much she will spend on the ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4 \text{ per carton} = \$16 \]

Therefore, after 60 days, she will spend \boxed{16",16,0,

2. She can run at a speed of \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.
3. She can walk at a speed of \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.
4. Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
5. The time she spends running is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
6. The time she spends walking is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.
7. Calculate the total distance:
   - Distance running: \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}\)
   - Distance walking: \(1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}\)
   - Total distance: \(12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}\)

50,346,ar,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per day.
2. Determine the number of eggs produced per week.
3. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens.
4. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

Next, we calculate the number of eggs produced per week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Now, we convert the number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Finally, we calculate the revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]",294,0,

Calculate the percentage increase:
\[
150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
\]

Add the increase to the original value to find the new value:
\[
80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of buying the house and the repairs:
\[
80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
\]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[
200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

Substitute \( D \) in the total age equation:

Solve for \( A \):

\[ A = \frac{162 \times 11}{18} \]

1. Calculate the 25% delivery fee:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
   \]

2. Add the delivery fee to the original bill:
   \[
   40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00
   \]

3. Add the $3.00 delivery fee:
   \[
   50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00
   \]

4. Add the $4.00 tip:
   \[
   53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
- Total cost for donuts: \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \)

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
- Total cost for mini cupcakes: \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \)

Then, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
- Total cost for mini cheesecakes: \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \)

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost: \( 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \)

The total number of students is 200, and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:

Since the total number of students is 200 and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:

To find the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls:

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire trail, the total time she needs to take to complete the trail is:

\[

Next, John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties is:

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since the cost of each blue tie is $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\]

Now, calculate the total cost for the red ties. Since each red tie costs $60 and there are 10 red ties, the total cost for the red ties is:
\[

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - One pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = \(3 \times 42 = 126\).

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ jelly beans}
   \]
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[

   \]

Now, we sum these guesses:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses:
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80

Mary will give away 1 potted plant from each ledge, which means she will give away 40 plants. After giving away these 40 plants, the number of potted plants she will remain with is:
\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \]

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.

\[
20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 35000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from cheerleading:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.

\[
30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 15 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 22500 \text{ dollars}

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled during the outbound trip.**

Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour and he sails for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM). The distance is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to travel back.**

Tom's ship travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time it takes to travel 30 miles at this speed is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time it takes Tom to get back is 5 hours.",5,0,

The cost of the chicken meal is:
\[ 12 \]

The cost of the 5 packs of milk is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The cost of the 4 apples is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of the items other than the pizza boxes:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \]

Since Marie paid a total of $50, we subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount to find the cost of the pizza boxes:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie ordered:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. Since the cost of a blue tie is $40, the cost of a red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of a red tie} = 40 \times 1.5 = 60

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the ties:

First, let's calculate her earnings for the weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday.
- Each class has 15 students.
- Judy teaches from Monday to Friday, so there are 5 weekdays.
- Total students per weekday = 5 classes * 15 students per class = 75 students.
- Total earnings for weekdays = 5 weekdays * $15 per student = $825.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students.
- Total students on Saturday = 8 classes * 15 students per class = 120 students.
- Total earnings for Saturday = 120 students * $15 per student = $1800.

Finally, we add her earnings for the weekdays and Saturday to find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = $825 (weekdays) + $1800 (Saturday) = $2625.

First, we calculate the maximum weight that the truck can carry while crossing the bridge:
\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we determine how many boxes can be loaded into the truck without exceeding the maximum weight limit. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we divide the maximum weight the truck can carry by the weight of one box:
\[ \frac{1245}{15} \approx 83.000000000000002 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we take the floor of this value:
\[ \lfloor 83.000000000000002 \rfloor = 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83 boxes.",83,0,

2. Determine how many potted plants Mary will give away.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants.

First, we calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has initially:
- She received 18 new potted plants.
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, she has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) potted plants.

Adding these together gives us:
\[ 18 + 80 = 98 \]

Next, we determine how many potted plants Mary will give away:
- She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge.

So, she will give away:
\[ 40 \]

1. **Cost of chicken meal**: $12
2. **Cost of 5 packs of milk**: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars
3. **Cost of 4 apples**: \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars

Now, we sum these costs to find the total cost of the items other than the pizza boxes:
\[

Marie paid a total of $50. Subtracting the cost of the items from the total amount paid gives us the cost of the pizza boxes:
\[

\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box:

John has $5 left after buying the video games:

Therefore, we assume he still has $5 from selling his lego sets. Since he sells each lego set for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:

2. **Bad oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.

3. **Unripe oranges**: 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate:
   \[
   0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]
   So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

4. **Sour oranges**: There are 2 sour oranges.

Now, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:

\[
\text{Good oranges} = 25 - 1 - 5 - 2
\]

\[
\text{Good oranges} = 25 - 8
\]

\[
\text{Good oranges} = 17

   - Total revenue: $2.74 * 12 = $32.88

2. Calculate the revenue from petunias:
   - Price of petunias per pot: $1.87
   - Number of pots sold: 9

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy consumes 1 cup every day.
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. For the remaining 180 days, the puppy consumes 2 cups every day.
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 360 \text{ cups}
   \]

Adding these two amounts together, we get:
\[
180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups}

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required if one bag contains 110 cups.

1. If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets a full annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Since Marcy works for 30 years, she is not yet entitled to the full pension but has reached the point where she gets 5% of the total pension.

Let's denote the total pension after 30 years as \( P \). According to the problem, if Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000. Therefore, \( P = 50000 \).

Since Marcy works for 30 years, she gets 5% of the total pension:
\[
\text{Annual Pension} = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500

Thus, Marcy's annual pension will be \(2500\).",25000,0,

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each: \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each: \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Total revenue for Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each: \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- Total revenue for Friday: \(480\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- Revenue on Thursday: \(520\) dollars
- Revenue on Friday: \(480\) dollars
- Difference in revenue: \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

50,514,ar,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find the total number of eggs produced per week. Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[
252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}
\]

Next, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide 1764 by 12:
\[
\frac{1764}{12} = 147 \text{ dozens/week}
\]

Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so the total revenue from selling 147 dozens is:
\[
147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week}
\]",294,0,

Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. He sails for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM).

The distance traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine the time it takes Tom to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour for the same distance.

The distance to travel back is 30 miles.

The time it takes to travel back is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = \frac{30}{6} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the time it takes Tom to get back is:
\[ \boxed{5 \, \text{hours}} \]",5,0,

2. Determine how much money John spent on video games.
3. Calculate how much money John had left after buying the video games.
4. Determine how many lego sets John still has.

First, let's calculate the total money John made from selling his lego sets:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's determine how much money John spent on video games. We know he spent $5 on video games and had $5 left, so:
\[ \text{Money left after buying video games} = 195 - 5 = 190 \]

Now, let's calculate how much money John had left after buying the video games. Since he bought 8 video games for $20 each:
\[ \text{Money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

   - Total charge for the first half: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \)

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - Reduced monthly charge: 10% of $140 less than the initial charge
   - Reduced monthly charge: \( 140 - 0.10 \times 140 = 140 - 14 = 126 \)
   - Number of months in the second half of the year: 6
   - Total charge for the second half: \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \)

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Total charge for the first half: $840
   - Total charge for the second half: $756

31,538,ar,"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate each friend's guess:**
   - The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
   - The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
     \[
     \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
     \]
   - The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess.
     \[
     80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
     \]

2. **Sum the guesses:**
   \[
   80 + 60 + 100 = 240
   \]

3. **Divide the total by the number of friends to find the average:**
   \[
   \frac{240}{3} = 80
   \]

Therefore, the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar is \(80\).",80,0,

45,546,ar,"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then use the given average time per article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = \( 5 \times (1 + \frac{2}{5}) = 5 \times \frac{7}{5} = 7 \).

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \).

Now, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

1. Determine Alex's weight based on the given information.
2. Add Alex's weight to Grace's weight.

First, let's calculate Alex's weight:
- Grace weighs 125 pounds.
- Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.
- 4 times Grace's weight is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) pounds.
- Subtract 2 pounds from 500 pounds to find Alex's weight:
  \[
  \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Next, add Alex's weight to Grace's weight:
- Grace's weight is 125 pounds.
- Alex's weight is 498 pounds.
- Their combined weight is:
  \[
  125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds}

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.

2. **Annual Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year.

3. **Calculate the Increase**:
   - Initial salary: $600
   - Increase per year: 10% of $600 = $600 * 0.10 = $60
   - New monthly salary after one year: $600 + $60 = $660

4. **Total Years of Service**: Sylvie has already been in the company for 5 years. Therefore, her total years of service after three more years will be 5 years + 3 years = 8 years.

5. **Calculate Annual Salary**:
   - New monthly salary: $660
   - Annual salary: $660 * 12 = $7920

Next, we find the number of girls. The total number of students is 200, and 80 of them are boys:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we calculate the number of girls in the Girl Scouts. Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, we find:
\[
\text{Number of girls in Girl Scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80

1. **Calculate the volume of sauce that came from the tomatoes:**
   - The total volume of sauce made is 32 ounces.
   - Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the volume of sauce that comes directly from the tomatoes is:
     \[
     \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{2} = 16 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of cans used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - The number of cans used is:
     \[
     \frac{16 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 1 \text{ can}

38,570,ar,"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total number of hours he runs in a week and then divide the total miles he runs in a week by this number.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week:
- On the first day, he runs 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- On the third day, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \]
So, John runs for a total of 6 hours in a week.

Next, we divide the total miles he runs in a week by the total number of hours to find his running speed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, John runs 10 miles per hour.",10,0,

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   \[
   \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we sum the number of all the gems:
\[
\text{Total gems} = \text{Number of diamonds} + \text{Number of rubies} + \text{Number of emeralds}
\]
\[
\text{Total gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595

1. Calculate the number of boys in the school.
2. Calculate the total number of students in the school.
3. Determine the number of teachers based on the given ratio of students to teachers.

First, we know there are 60 girls in the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

We are given that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the ratio of students to teachers:
\[
\text{Number of teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

50,586,ar,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we calculate the number of eggs produced per week. Since Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day, in one week (7 days), they produce:

\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ 1764 \div 12 = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so the total revenue per week is:

\[ 147 \times 2 = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

62,586,ar,"To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years of work, we need to consider the given conditions:

1. If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Let's denote the total pension value after 20 years as \( P \). Since she has been working for 20 years and is now entitled to 5% of the pension per year, we can calculate \( P \) as follows:

\[ P = \frac{50000}{0.05} = 1000000 \]

Now, we need to determine her annual pension after 30 years. Since she has been working for 30 years, her annual pension will be 5% of the total pension value:

\[ \text{Annual pension} = 0.05 \times 1000000 = 50000 \]

Therefore, her annual pension will be:

1. **Cost of the material:**
   Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch.

2. **Cost of the construction:**
   Janet pays $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Total cost before insurance:**
   \[
   500 + 800 = 1300
   \]

4. **Insurance cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost before insurance to get it insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:
   \[
   0.10 \times 1300 = 130
   \]

5. **Total amount paid:**
   Adding the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance, we get:
   \[

Step 1: Identify the relationship between the original price and the discounted price.
Since the book was sold at a 25% discount, the discounted price is 75% of the original price. Therefore, the discounted price can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 0.75P \]

Step 2: Substitute the given discounted price into the equation.
We know that the discounted price is $19.50, so we can write:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

Step 3: Solve for the original price \( P \).
To find \( P \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Step 4: Perform the division.
\[ P = 26 \]

Thus, the original price of the book was \(26\).",26,0,

57,610,ar,"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the truck when loaded.
2. Determine the maximum weight that the bridge can carry.
3. Calculate the number of boxes that can be loaded without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

First, we know the weight of the truck when loaded can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the boxes alone can be at most:
\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded without exceeding 1245 pounds, we divide 1245 by 15:
\[ 1245 \div 15 = 83 \]

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is:
\[ 83 \]

1. **Number of Dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Number of Cats:**
   There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. First, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   Then, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

4. **Total Number of Pets:**
   The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

First, let's calculate the distance John drives in the first segment:
- He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance John drives in the second segment:
- He drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

Finally, let's calculate the distance John drives in the third segment:
- He drives for 1 hour at a speed of 80 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1 hour = 80 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances from all three segments:
- Total Distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 80 miles = 275 miles.

1. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
2. Determine how much farther she can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone and subtract this distance from the reach of the dragon's flames.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, so the distance she can throw it is:
\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much farther she can throw the javelin from the reach of the dragon's flames. The reach of the dragon's flames is 1000 feet, so the distance she can throw the javelin outside the reach is:
\[ 1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet} \]

She walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in another 1 hour.

Total distance walked = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Next, let's calculate the total distance she needs to walk and the time she has left to walk.

Total distance to walk = 12 miles
Remaining distance = Total distance to walk - Total distance walked = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles
Time left = Total time available - Total time spent = Total time available - 2 hours = Total time available - 2 hours = 1 hour

Now, let's calculate the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

But since we are given that her average speed should be 4 miles per hour for the entire trail, we need to adjust our calculation to meet this average.

52,634,ar,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, so:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. Subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight to be removed gives us the combined weight of the remaining toys:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, we need to find out how many toys are required to weigh 7.5 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight of the toys by the weight of one toy:

\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final answer is:

\[

1. Calculate Sylvie's initial annual salary.
2. Determine the annual salary increase.
3. Calculate the total salary increase over the next three years.
4. Add the total increase to her initial salary.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial annual salary.**
Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600, so her initial annual salary is:
\[ 600 \times 12 = 7200 \]

**Step 2: Determine the annual salary increase.**
The annual salary increase is 10% of the initial salary, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 7200 = 720 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total salary increase over the next three years.**
Since the increase is annual, the total increase over three years is:
\[ 720 \times 3 = 2160 \]

**Step 4: Add the total increase to her initial salary.**

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Cost per dozen donuts = $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \(3 \times 68 = 204\).

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cupcakes = $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Cost per dozen mini cheesecakes = $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \(6 \times 55 = 330\).

- Time to walk first 4 miles: 1 hour
- Time to walk next 2 miles: 1 hour
- Total time spent: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Next, calculate the total distance Marissa has walked so far.
- Distance walked: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles

Now, find the remaining distance she needs to cover.
- Total distance: 12 miles
- Distance walked: 6 miles
- Remaining distance: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

Let \( v \) be the speed required for the remaining 6 miles. The average speed for the entire hike should be 4 miles per hour.
- Total time: 2 hours + 6 miles / \( v \)
- Total time: 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

Therefore, \( v = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 2 \) miles per hour.

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of \(2 miles per hour.",6,0,

1. For the package of 3 flowers:
   - Cost per package = $2.50
   - Number of packages required = \(\left\lceil \frac{18}{3} \right\rceil = 6\)
   - Total cost = \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars

2. For the package of 2 flowers:
   - Cost per package = $1
   - Number of packages required = \(\left\lceil \frac{18}{2} \right\rceil = 9\)
   - Total cost = \(9 \times 1 = 18\) dollars

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 = $15
- Cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 = $18

The better price is for the package of 3 flowers, which costs $15. Therefore, Vincent saves $3 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

**Step 1: Determine Alex's weight.**

Grace's weight is given as 125 pounds. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. Therefore, we calculate Alex's weight as follows:

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 125 \):

\[
4 \times 125 = 500
\]

Next, subtract 2 from 500:

\[
500 - 2 = 478
\]

So, Alex's weight is 478 pounds.

**Step 2: Calculate their combined weights.**

Now, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight:

Step 1: Calculate the number of sprints James runs in a week.
James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week. Therefore, the total number of sprints in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ sprints/week} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total distance James runs in one session.
Each sprint is 60 meters long, so the total distance for one session is:
\[ 9 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 540 \text{ meters/session} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.
Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total distance for a week is:
\[ 540 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 1620 \text{ meters/week} \]

1. Calculate the number of friends who will show up.
2. Determine the number of gift bags needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

1. **Calculate the number of friends who will show up:**
   - Christina invited 16 friends.
   - 1/4 of the attendees do not show up.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \) friends do not show up.
   - The number of friends who will show up is \( 16 - 4 = 12 \).

2. **Determine the number of gift bags needed:**
   - Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest.
   - Therefore, she needs \( 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \) gift bags.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the gift bags:**
   - Each gift bag costs $2.

70,658,ar,"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate her earnings for weekdays and Saturday separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings for weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 dance classes each weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15 per student.
- Number of students per weekday = 5 classes/day * 15 students/class = 75 students/day
- Earnings per weekday = 75 students/day * $15/student = $1125/day
- Total earnings for weekdays = 5 days * $1125/day = $5625

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 dance classes on Saturday.
- Earnings for Saturday = 8 classes * 15 students/class * $15/student = $1800

Finally, let's sum her total earnings for the week:
- Total earnings for the week = $5625 (weekdays) + $1800 (Saturday) = $7425

Given:
- The number of dogs is 60.
- There are two cats for every dog.
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.

First, we calculate the number of cats:
\[
\text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[
\text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

Then, we calculate the number of rabbits:
\[
\text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168
\]

Finally, we find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
\]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens.

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire eats in one week. She eats 3 eggs each day, and there are 7 days in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen:
\[ 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

1. Calculate the total number of miles John runs in a week.
2. Calculate the total time in hours John runs in a week.
3. Divide the total number of miles by the total time to find the running speed.

First, we know John runs 60 miles a week.

Next, let's calculate the total time in hours he runs in a week.

- On the first day, John runs 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- On the third day, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \]

Finally, we divide the total number of miles by the total time to find the running speed:

- On Thursday, the mechanic also repaired 4 car tires at $40 each.
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160
  \]
- Total revenue for Thursday:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each.
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480
  \]

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
\[
520 - 480 = 40
\]

Therefore, the final result is:
\[

27,690,ar,"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia eats in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs.
3. Calculate the total cost of the cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings in 60 days.**
Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream are needed.**
Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide 60 by 15:
\[ \frac{60}{15} = 4 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the cartons.**
Each carton costs $4.00. To find the total cost for 4 cartons, we multiply 4 by 4:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

93,690,ar,"Let's denote Gerald's original time for running the 400-meter hurdles as \( G \) seconds.

Given:
- Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
- Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.

From the information given, we can set up the following equation:
\[ G + 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 - 2 \]
\[ G = 36 \]

So, Gerald originally ran the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

With his improved diet, Gerald's speed increased by 10%. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time:
\[ \text{New time} = 36 + 0.10 \times 36 = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

1. **Seattle's sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80

3. **Toulouse's sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Now, we add the number of sheep from all three cities to find the total.

\[
\text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep}
\]
\[
\text{Total sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

First, calculate the number of blue ties John bought:

Now, determine the cost per red tie:

1. Calculate the revenue from marigolds:
   - Price per pot of marigold: $2.74
   - Number of pots sold: 12
   - Revenue: \(12 \times 2.74 = 32.88\)

2. Calculate the revenue from petunias:
   - Price per pot of petunia: $1.87
   - Number of pots sold: 9

Next, calculate her weekly earnings for her job as a cheerleading coach. She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week:

2. Convert the number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs produced per week. Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs/week}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   Since there are two cats for every dog, we calculate the number of cats as follows:

3. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**

   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180

   The number of rabbits is then:

Now, we calculate how many girls are in the Girl Scout. Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout, we find:

Finally, we determine the number of girls not in the Girl Scout by subtracting the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls:

1. Calculate the square footage of each level.
2. Sum the square footage of all levels.
3. Divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average.

Step 1: Calculate the square footage of each level.
- Level 1: 16 square feet
- Level 2: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
- Level 3: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
- Level 4: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Step 2: Sum the square footage of all levels.
\[
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square feet}
\]

Step 3: Divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average.
\[
\frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(7.5\).",60,0,

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we calculate the number of cats as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

2. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is given to be twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the combined number of dogs and cats is:
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   Thus, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   Adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits gives:

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, David's laundry can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, Raymond's laundry can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{David's laundry} - \text{Raymond's laundry} = 100 - 200 = -100 \text{ pounds}

   - Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Charleston has 80 sheep.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

3. **Calculate the total number of sheep:**
   - Toulouse has 160 sheep.
   - Charleston has 80 sheep.
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

  \[
  80 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 160 \text{ miles}

- Since there are two trains, the total distance covered northward is:
  \[
  150 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 300 \text{ miles}

Now, we add the distances covered in each direction to find the total distance covered by each train:

81,754,ar,"To determine how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to follow the steps of the problem and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Initial number of stickers:**
   Charlie starts with 10 stickers.

2. **Stickers bought from the store:**
   Charlie buys 21 stickers from the store.
   \[
   10 + 21 = 31
   \]
   So, Charlie now has 31 stickers.

3. **Stickers received for the birthday:**
   Charlie receives 23 more stickers for his birthday.
   \[
   31 + 23 = 54
   \]
   So, Charlie now has 54 stickers.

4. **Stickers given to his sister:**
   Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister.
   \[
   54 - 9 = 25
   \]
   So, Charlie now has 25 stickers.

5. **Stickers used to decorate a greeting card:**
   The problem states that 28 stickers were used, but this information is not needed to find the final number of stickers Charlie has.",17,0,

31,770,ar,"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to determine the guesses made by each friend.

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Therefore, the second friend says:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. Therefore, the third friend says:
   \[
   80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average guess by summing up all the guesses and dividing by the number of friends:

\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess of the number of jelly beans is:
\[
\boxed{80

24,778,ar,"To determine the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid is 75% of the original price. This is because a 25% discount means the price after the discount is 75% of the original price.

Let \( P \) be the original price of the book. The price Kyle paid, after the discount, is given as $19.50. Therefore, we can write the relationship between the original price and the discounted price as follows:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = 19.50 \times \frac{1}{0.75} = 19.50 \times \frac{4}{3} = 26 \]

1. Regular pay: The first 40 hours are paid at $10 per hour, so her regular earnings are $10/hour * 40 hours = $400.

2. Overtime pay: The remaining hours (45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours) are paid at $1.20 times her regular hourly rate. Since her regular rate is $10 per hour, her overtime rate is $1.20 * $10/hour = $12 per hour. Therefore, her overtime earnings are $12/hour * 5 hours = $60.

3. Total earnings: Adding her regular and overtime earnings gives her total earnings for the week. Thus, her total earnings are $400 + $60 = $460.

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.",460,0,

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) and had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
2. She sold 2 more to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = \frac{x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{6} - 1 \) and had \( \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{6} + 1 = \frac{x}{6} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so \( \frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5 \).

   - A 300g bag has 5 servings.
   - Each serving contains 250 calories.
   - Total calories per bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories/bag.

2. Determine how many calories you can consume without exceeding your daily target:
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Calories left to consume = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. Calculate the number of servings you can consume based on the remaining calories:
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - Number of servings = 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.

4. Convert the number of servings to grams:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}

Next, we need to remove a total of 15 pounds. After removing 7.5 pounds through the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys are needed to remove 7.5 pounds, we divide 7.5 by the weight of one toy:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:

Calculating the multiplication:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 478 \]

Now, we find their combined weights:
\[ \text{Combined weights} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]

- Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour each day.
- Therefore, the total time spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time Jim spends on TV and reading each week:
- Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

Finally, let's calculate the total time Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks:
- The total time spent in 4 weeks is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[ 3 \times 68 = 204 \]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \]
So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[ 6 \times 55 = 330 \]
So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, we sum up the costs:

- She charges $15 per student.

The total number of students in the weekdays is:

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy to have enough yogurts for 30 days. We do this by dividing the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per pack:

Each pack costs $5.00, so the total cost for 15 packs is:

2. Next, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens, since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen. We know that 1 dozen equals 12 eggs. Therefore, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
   \[
   \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens/week}
   \]

3. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

87,826,ar,"Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. After 5 years, her salary increases by 10% of $600 per year. So, her salary after 5 years is:

\[ 600 + 0.10 \times 600 = 600 + 60 = 660 \text{ per month} \]

Now, let's calculate her salary after another year (total of 6 years):

\[ 660 + 0.10 \times 660 = 660 + 66 = 726 \text{ per month} \]

Finally, we need to calculate her salary after another year (total of 7 years):

\[ 726 + 0.10 \times 726 = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \text{ per month} \]

Therefore, her annual salary after three more years of service is:

\[ 798.6 \times 12 = 9583 \text{ per year} \]",9360,0,

47,842,ar,"First, determine the number of blue ties John bought. Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, calculate the number of red ties John bought. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, determine the cost per red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Calculate the total cost for the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost for red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, sum the costs of the blue and red ties to find the total expenditure:

\[
\text{Total expenditure} = 200 + 600 = 800

11,858,ar,"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
\[ 3 \times 68 = 204 \]
So, the cost of the donuts is $204.

Next, calculate the cost of mini cupcakes:
Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \]
So, the cost of mini cupcakes is $160.

Then, calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes:
Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
\[ 6 \times 55 = 330 \]
So, the cost of mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, we add up all the costs to get the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694

28,858,ar,"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the position of the first stop:**
   Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.

2. **Determine the position of the second stop:**
   Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of his 60-mile trip. This means he stopped after 15 miles before 60 miles.

3. **Calculate the distance between the two stops:**
   To find the distance between the first and second stops, we subtract the position of the first stop from the position of the second stop.

First, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults at the picnic.
\[
10 \text{ pounds/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is 5 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 children at the picnic.
\[
5 \text{ pounds/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we sum the amounts needed for the adults and children:
\[

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - To find the reduced number of downloads, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180.
   \[

   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - She skips at half the speed she runs, so her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana runs at four times the speed she walks, so her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 18\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the distance Dana spends running:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running.
   - Time spent running = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - Distance run = \(\text{run speed} \times \text{time spent running} = 6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.

1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, solve for \( L \):

\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won using the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games.",15,0,

Given:

Therefore, we can express Lee's initial time in terms of Gerald's initial time:

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 36 \]

So, Gerald initially runs the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

With the improved diet, Gerald's speed improves by 10%. To find his new time after the improvement, we calculate 90% of his initial time:

1. First, we know the number of downloads in the first month is 60.
2. The problem states the number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month. 
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]
3. The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   - Calculate 30% of 180:
     \[
     0.30 \times 180 = 54
     \]
   - Subtract this from the downloads in the second month to get the downloads in the third month:
     \[
     \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - 54 = 126
     \]
4. Finally, sum up the total downloads over the three months:
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

35,882,ar,"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

1. **Points in the first 20 minutes:**
   Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

2. **Points in the second 20 minutes:**
   Mike scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes. To find out how many more points he scores, we calculate 25% of 4:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
   \]
   Therefore, he scores:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} in the second 20 minutes.

- Marigolds: $2.74 per pot rounded to $3.00
- Petunias: $1.87 per pot rounded to $1.90
- Begonias: $2.12 per pot rounded to $2.10

Next, we'll calculate the total revenue for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 per pot = $36.00
- Petunias: 9 pots * $1.90 per pot = $17.10
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2.10 per pot = $35.70

Now, we add up the revenues from all types of flowers to find the total revenue:

\[
36 + 17.10 + 35.70 = 88.80

First, let's calculate the total time she has already spent walking. She walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in another 1 hour, so a total of 6 miles in 2 hours.

To get an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail, she needs to cover 12 miles in a total of 3 hours. She has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

We need her to walk 6 miles in the remaining 1.5 hours (3 hours - 2 hours).

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = 4 \text{ miles per hour}

   The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.

3. **Determine the distance to the second stop:**
   Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Therefore, the distance to the second stop is:

4. **Calculate the distance between the first and second stops:**
   The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the distance to the second stop and the distance to the first stop:

1. **Identify James's age:**
   James is 10 years old.

2. **Determine Corey's age:**
   James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey's age is:
   \[
   \text{Corey's age} = \text{James's age} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]

3. **Determine Amy's age:**
   Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, Amy's age is:
   \[
   \text{Amy's age} = \text{Corey's age} - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9

4. **Determine Jackson's age:**
   Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson's age is:
   \[

44,914,ar,"First, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, we calculate:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of supplies. Each pound of beeswax and wicks costs $10.00, so:

\[
2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20
\]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle sells for $2.00, so:

\[
20 \text{ candles} \times \$2/\text{candle} = \$40
\]

Finally, we find the net profit by subtracting the total cost of supplies from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Net Profit} = \$40 - \$20 = \$20
\]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:

1. The total weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

First, we find the remaining weight capacity of the bridge by subtracting the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the total weight limit:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, can fit into this remaining weight capacity. We do this by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} \]

Performing the division:

\[ 1245 \div 15 = 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is \(83\boxed{}\).",83,0,

2. There is a 2% interest charge on each unit.
3. The installment period is 3 months.

First, calculate the total cost of the cell phones:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

Next, calculate the total interest for the first 3 months. The interest per month is 2% of the total cost:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 0.02 \times 750 = 15 \]

Since the interest is charged monthly, the total interest for 3 months is:
\[ \text{Total interest} = 15 \times 3 = 45 \]

Now, calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month:
\[ \text{Total amount per month} = 750 + 45 = 795 \]

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of installments to find the monthly payment:

   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, so each serving is 250 calories / 5 servings = 50 calories per serving.

2. Calculate the daily calorie limit:
   - The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calorie limit is 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

3. Determine how many servings you can eat with 200 calories:
   - If each serving is 50 calories, then with 200 calories, you can eat 200 / 50 = 4 servings.

4. Calculate the total grams of chips you can eat with 4 servings:
   - Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, each serving is 300g / 5 = 60g.

2. Calculate the number of rubies based on the given relationship.
3. Calculate the number of emeralds based on the given relationship.
4. Sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to get the total number of gems.

1. The number of diamonds is 175.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. Therefore, the number of rubies is:

82,930,ar,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the combined weight of Grace and Alex. Let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Determine Alex's weight.**

We know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 478 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the combined weight of Grace and Alex.**

Now, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 125 + 478 \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 603 \]

84,930,ar,"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( W \) be the number of games won by the team.
- Let \( L \) be the number of games lost by the team.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can set up the following equations based on these statements:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Now, we can find the number of games won using the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games.",15,0,

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost of donuts is $68 per dozen.
   - Total cost for donuts = \(3 \times 68 = 204\)

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost of mini cupcakes is $80 per dozen.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \(2 \times 80 = 160\)

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost of mini cheesecakes is $55 per dozen.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \(6 \times 55 = 330\)

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has.
2. Add the new potted plants she received.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants she will give away.

First, calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:
- She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the total number of potted plants she already has is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

Next, add the new potted plants she received:
- She received 18 new potted plants.
- So, the total number of potted plants she has now is \(80 + 18 = 98\).

Finally, subtract the number of potted plants she will give away:
- She will give away 1 potted plant from each ledge.
- Therefore, the total number of potted plants she will give away is \(40\).
- Subtract this from the total: \(98 - 40 = \boxed{",58,0,

64,954,ar,"Sophia has driven 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas. The car's owner's manual states that the tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank, we need to determine the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg).

First, let's calculate the miles driven per gallon:
\[
\text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Total miles driven}}{\text{Total gallons used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
\]

Now, we know the car's fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon. Since the tank holds 12 gallons of gas, the total miles the car can drive on a full tank is:
\[
\text{Total miles} = \text{Miles per gallon} \times \text{Total gallons in tank} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 \boxed{} miles on a full tank.",300,0,

1. Calculate the total revenue from each type of flower.
2. Sum the revenues from all types of flowers to get the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the revenue from each type of flower:

- Marigolds:
  - Price per pot: $2.74
  - Number of pots sold: 12
  - Revenue from marigolds: \(2.74 \times 12 = 33\)

- Petunias:
  - Price per pot: $1.87
  - Number of pots sold: 9
  - Revenue from petunias: \(1.87 \times 9 = 17\)

- Begonias:
  - Price per pot: $2.12
  - Number of pots sold: 17
  - Revenue from begonias: \(2.12 \times 17 = 37\)

Now, we sum the revenues from all types of flowers:

Given:
- Total number of students = 200
- Fraction of boys = 2/5

Number of boys = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \)

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
Number of girls = \( 200 - 80 = 120 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the Girl Scout.

Given:
- Fraction of girls in the Girl Scout = 2/3

Number of girls in the Girl Scout = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \)

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the Girl Scout, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the Girl Scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the Girl Scout
Number of girls not in the Girl Scout = \( 120 - 80 = 40 \)

   - Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB per minute.
   - The file is 200 GB.
   - Download time without interruptions = Total size / Download rate = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

2. Next, calculate the download time considering the interruption:
   - The interruption occurs 40% of the way through the download, which is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.
   - After the interruption, Carla needs to download the remaining 80 GB.
   - Since the download rate is 2 GB per minute, the time to download 80 GB is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

3. Add the time for the restart:
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

4. Sum up all the times:
   - Total download time = 100 minutes (without interruptions) + 40 minutes (after interruption) + 20 minutes (restart) = 160 minutes.

52,970,ar,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total weight of 30 comic books.
2. Subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove.
3. Determine how many toys are required to make up the remaining weight.

First, let's find the total weight of 30 comic books. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, the weight of 30 comic books is:
\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:
\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many toys weigh 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys required is:
\[
7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.",15,0,

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
- Total cost for donuts = 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
- Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 * $80 = $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
- Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

1. **Determine the number of pets Cindy has:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Determine the number of pets Marcia has:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = \text{Number of pets Cindy has} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Determine the number of pets Jan has:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
   \]

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is \(28\).",28,0,

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{18}{3} \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 \text{ hours} - \frac{18}{3} \text{ hours} \]

To subtract 9 from \(\frac{27}{3}\), we first convert 9 to a fraction with a common denominator:

\[ 9 = \frac{27}{3} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = \frac{27}{3} - \frac{18}{3} = \frac{9}{3} \text{ hours} \]

2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's find the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.
\[

So, the total number of units in the building is 120.

So, 90 units are occupied.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Therefore, the revenue from the cheesecakes is:
  \[
  23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we sum the revenue from the brownies and the revenue from the cheesecakes to find the total amount of money raised:
  \[
  129 + 92 = 221 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Thus, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:
\[

82,1002,ar,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Alex's weight first and then add it to Grace's weight.

1. **Determine Alex's weight:**
   - We know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.
   - Grace weighs 125 pounds.
   - Therefore, Alex's weight is \(4 \times 125 - 2\).

2. **Calculate Alex's weight:**
   - First, multiply 4 by 125:
     \[
     4 \times 125 = 500
     \]
   - Then, subtract 2 from 500:
     \[
     500 - 2 = 498
     \]
   - So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

3. **Calculate their combined weights:**
   - Grace's weight: 125 pounds
   - Alex's weight: 498 pounds
   - Combined weight: \(125 + 498 = 623\) pounds

Thus, their combined weights in pounds is \(623\).",623,0,

76,1010,ar,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food consumed throughout the year.

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days:
\[
1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 180 days:
\[
2 \text{ cups/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 360 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, we add these two amounts to find the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[
180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups}
\]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required:
\[
\frac{540 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags}

1. **Identify the number of dogs and cats:**
   - Given that the number of dogs is 60.
   - There are two cats for every dog.
   - Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats = 60 + 120 = 180.

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.
